# LAJAM Bibliometrics (2002-2010)

This repo contains the R code, data, and output for the paper:

Palacios, D.M., C.A. Martins, and C. Olavarr√≠a. 2011. Aquatic mammal science in
Latin America: a bibliometric analysis for the first eight years of the Latin
American Journal of Aquatic Mammals (2002-2010). *Latin American Journal of
Aquatic Mammals* 9(2):42-64, https://doi.org/10.5597/lajam00174.

This repo was created in GitHub in May 2022. The file structure has been
organized as folders for `code`, `data`, and `graphics`, and each folder has
subfolders for `data_plots`, `network_analysis`, and `word_clouds`. Note,
however, that the work was originally done outside of GitHub in 2012-2013, so
the workflows and file paths for input/output predate the file structure in this
repo. In time, the scripts should be updated to reflect the correct (relative)
file paths, modern coding syntax, and new packages R that have since superseded
the ones used when this work was done.
