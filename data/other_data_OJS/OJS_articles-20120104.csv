155,"Movement patterns of franciscana dolphins <i>(Pontoporia blainvillei)</i> in Bahia Anegada, Buenos Aires, Argentina","From January 1993 to July 1999, systematic sightings of franciscana dolphins were conducted from four shore-based stations in Bahia Anegada, Argentina. Data were recorded using focal animal/group sampling methods. This study tested the hypothesis that dolphin movements within Bahia Anegada were random, assuming independence of sightings. The trend in dolphin swimming movement was defined as a direction scored as 'coming in', 'neutral', and 'going out'. In total 338 sightings were recorded, with a total effort of 2674 hours. The relative frequency of franciscana sightings demonstrated that movement was significantly dependent on tidal state, rejecting the hypothesis that dolphin swimming directions within the study area are random. Significant associations were also observed in the relative frequency of sightings in relation to the shore-based stations, suggesting a differential use of the bay's habitats perhaps due to location of prey, tidal current speed, depth, and topography of the coast.",P.,,Bordino,,,imspb@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
156,"Feeding ecology of the franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) in marine and estuarine waters of Argentina","Stomach contents of 110 franciscanas (Pontoporia blainvillei), from northern Argentina were analysed in order to improve our knowledge about the feeding habits of this species and to better characterise the lactation period. The samples included calves, juveniles and adults of both sexes. Evidence of predation by franciscanas is seen at a very young age (2.5-3 months), with a transition diet composed by both milk and solid food, mainly represented by crustaceans. Weaning seems to begin by April, when franciscanas are about 6-7 months old. Franciscanas inhabiting two different habitats were analysed in this study: a brackish water estuary and an adjacent marine coastal system. The diet of Pontoporia blainvillei in northern Argentina was composed by a total of 26 prey species: 20 teleosts, 4 crustaceans and 2 cephalopods. Based on the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) the main prey species were Cynoscion guatucupa, Micropogonias furnieri, Loligo sanpaulensis and Urophycis brasiliensis. Estuarine franciscanas preyed mainly on Micropogonias furnieri (dominant species), Cynoscion guatucupa, Odonthestes argentinensis and Macrodon ancylodon, while dolphins from marine areas preyed mainly on Cynoscion guatucupa (dominant species), Loligo sanpaulensis and Urophycis brasiliensis. Our results confirm that franciscanas prey mainly on juvenile fish (<8cm) and small loliginid squids, in close agreement with previous results obtained in southern Brazil and Uruguay. Qualitative and quantitative differences observed in the diet of dolphins from each habitat emphasise the need to discriminate between samples from different habitats and environmental parameters.",R.,,Bastida,,," ",,,L.,,Rivero,,," ",,,D.,,Rodríguez,,,dhrodri@mdp.edu.ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
157,"Accumulation of heavy metals in the franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) from Buenos Aires Province, Argentina","Marine mammals accumulate heavy metals in their tissues at different concentrations according to trophic levels and environmental conditions. The franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a small coastal species inhabiting the marine and estuarine areas of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Its diet includes numerous species of small fish, squid and crustaceans. The aims of this study were to (i) assess the heavy metal concentration and burden distribution in different franciscana age classes and sex, and to (ii) evaluate both the accumulation processes and the transplacental transference of zinc, cadmium, copper and total mercury. Heavy metal concentrations (wet weight) were determined in eighteen dolphins by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS), by the cold vapour technique (mercury) or with air/acetylene flame (cadmium, zinc and copper). Liver showed the highest concentrations of mercury (max. 8.8 mg/g), zinc (max. 29.7 mg/g) and copper (max. 19.0 mg/g), whereas the highest cadmium concentrations (max. 6.7 mg/g) were found in kidney. Adults contained the highest concentrations for all heavy metals, followed by juveniles and calves in decreasing order, suggesting an age-related accumulation. No differences (p<0.05) were found between sexes within each age class. Organ burden distribution followed the same pattern for all metals and age classes: liver tissues contained maximum burdens. Mercury concentrations were higher than those of cadmium in both foetuses and newborns; and neither metal could be detected in the foetus. The analysed data suggested differences in the placental transference between metals, being significant for mercury and almost null in the case of cadmium. We can conclude that franciscana accumulates heavy metals and, due to its coastal distribution, it may be considered as a biomonitor of its environment.",J.,E.,Moreno,,," ",,,R.,O.,Bastida,,," ",,,V.,J.,Moreno,,," ",,,D.,,Rodríguez,,," ",,,M.,,Gerpe,,,msgerpe@mdp.edu.ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
158,"Trace metals in liver and kidney of the franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) from the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil","In the Southwestern Atlantic few studies have documented trace metal concentrations in cetacean tissues. This study presents both hepatic and renal trace metal concentrations (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Hg and Cd), in franciscana (n=17), inhabiting the waters of Rio de Janeiro State, southeastern Brazil. The concentrations of Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn and Hg generally were highest in the liver and Cd levels in liver and kidney were comparable. Hepatic and renal essential metal (Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn) concentrations were similar to those documented elsewhere for other species. THg and Cd concentrations were found to increase with age. The low concentrations of trace metals determined in the franciscana tissues in this study reflect its dietary habits, trophic position and the low bioavailability of metals in northern Rio de Janeiro.",M.,"F.

159,"Parasites of franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) from São Paulo and Paraná States, Brazil","The franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, is a threatened small cetacean of the western South Atlantic Ocean and is commonly caught incidentally in fishing nets along its distribution. Detailed studies regarding parasite loads of P. blainvillei have been recommended as a tool to evaluated ecological segregation and stock structure. We analyzed metazoan parasites from stomach, intestines and lungs of 41 franciscanas from three close geographical areas: Group 1, Guarujá and Praia Grande (São Paulo State), n=12 (24° 00'S, 46° 17'W); Group 2, Cananéia (São Paulo State), n=17 (25° 00'S, 47° 56'W); Group 3, Paraná State, n=12 (25° 30'S, 48° 23'W). The sample consists mainly of immature specimens, less than 3 years old. No parasites were found in the lungs analyzed. The acanthocephalan (Polymorphus sp.) found in two stomachs were considered occasional. The trematode Hadwenius pontoporiae (Digenea: Campulidae) was the only parasite found in the intestines with prevalence of 100%; for Group 1, 82.35%; for Group 2 and 58.33%; for Group 3. The mean intensity of H. pontoporiae for Groups 1, 2 and 3 was 39.5, 25.05 and 13.5 parasites per host, respectively. In this study there was a significant difference between the number of parasites among the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.012). Groups 2 and 3 are geographically close, and exhibited non-significant differences in the total number of parasites found (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.063). Groups 1 and 3, that are further apart geographically, differed significantly in the total number of parasites found (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.003). Through the analysis of data from the areas where H. pontoporiae was found [i.e. Areas 1, 2, 3 (this study), Rio Grande do Sul State and Argentina], it could be noticed that the prevalence and mean intensity increase as latitude increases. H. pontoporiae may continue to be useful as a biological tag for identifying franciscana's ecological stocks, together with information from genetic, morphometric and other biological studies. However, it is essential that standardized methodology be used in the collection of the parasite data.",J.,L.,Catão-Dias,,," ",,,R.,A.,Dias,,," ",,,M.,R.,Oliveira,,," ",,,A.,"L.

160,"DNA extraction from formalin fixed franciscana tissues","The present paper reports the extraction of DNA from formalin-fixed Pontoporia blainvillei tissues. Following the Vachot and Monerot (1996) protocol, fragmented DNA (300-700bp) was extracted from more than 95% of liver and muscle samples. DNA yield in liver samples was significantly higher than in muscle samples (4.574 ± 1.169mg DNA/mg versus 0.808 ± 0.297mg DNA/mg). Similar results were obtained from nine other species of cetaceans and five species of pinnipeds. It is of special interest to have a method that allows the utilisation of museum specimens not originally preserved for genetic studies, which may include rarely available, declining or extinct species.",P.-E.,,Olsson,,," ",,,R.,,Bastida,,," ",,,D.,,Rodríguez,,,dhrodri@mdp.edu.ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
161,"Morphology of the franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) off southeastern Brazil: sexual dimorphism, growth and geographic variation","Variations in body and skull morphology may exhibit geographic differences evidencing distinct population stocks. The objectives of the present study were to analyze such variation to test the hypothesis of a disjunct distribution of the franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) off the southeastern coast of Brazil. Body length and 39 cranial variables were measured from bycaught animals to considere sexual, ontogenetic and geographic variations. The areas studied were Espírito Santo (ES) (18°30'S-19°40'S), northern Rio de Janeiro (NRJ) (21°35'S-22°25'S) and São Paulo (SP) (23°30'S-25°30'S). Franciscanas from NRJ and SP presented significant sexual dimorphism, with the means for the metric characters larger for females than for males. Sexual dimorphism for franciscanas from ES was not examined due to limited sample size. The growth pattern for body and skull did not indicate clinal variation. The asymptotic values obtained for franciscanas from SP were smaller than the values obtained for franciscanas from NRJ and ES. Canonical discriminant analysis of the cranial metric characters indicated significant differences among the three geographic areas. Differences between areas ES and NRJ accounted for 85%; of the variation (axis 1). The remaining 15%; (axis 2) was due to difference between the area SP from the others. The geographic variation supports the hypothesis stock division in southeast Brazil; allopatry might be present. Therefore, three franciscana stocks from the southeastern coast of Brazil should be considered distinct for conservation and management actions.",N.,"R.

162,"Size and shape variability in the skull of <i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i> (Cetacea: Pontoporiidae) from the Brazilian coast","The existence of sexual dimorphism in Pontoporia blainvillei has long been known, with females being larger than males. However, no study so far has explored this dimorphism separately in its size and shape components. Here we analyse sexual dimorphism present in eight linear measurements of the skulls of 56 specimens (30 females and 26 males) of P. blainvillei from several localities along the Brazilian coast. We also investigate the sexual dimorphism in size and shape using geometric morphometric techniques, employing a subsample of the specimens above consisting of 27 skulls (12 females and 15 males). The analysis was based on landmarks digitized in four views of the skull: dorsal, ventral, lateral and occipital. A PCA showed the existence of two distinct populations, thus requiring the separation of two samples for the analysis of the effects of sexual dimorphism. Results of traditional and geometric morphometrics analyses revealed no sexual dimorphism in shape. All differences observed between the sexes are size related, with females bigger than males. Shape, however, is an important factor in the differentiation of at least two populations of this species.",M.,,Vivo,,," ",,,E.,,Hingst-Zaher,,," ",,,A.,,Higa,,,alehiga@usp.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
163,"Incidental mortality of franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) in the artisanal fishery of Praia Grande, São Paulo State, Brazil","The artisanal fishery in Praia Grande, São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil, was monitored between August 1998 and June 2001 through interviews with fishermen and onboard observations. The objective was to describe the fleet, the gear and the fishing activities, and to monitor the bycatch of small cetaceans. The Praia Grande fishing community has 20 fishermen who operate five aluminum and one wooden open boat. Seven types of gillnet and one beach seine net are used. Nets are made of nylon monofilament; net length and height range from 60-1800m and 1.5-10m, respectively. Mesh sizes vary from 7-30cm. Each type of net is set up according to target species and weather conditions. Fish of the families Sciaenidae, Carangidae, Carcharhinidae, Trichiuridae and Ariidae are the main species captured. The incidental mortality of 31 franciscanas was recorded. Thirteen specimens were collected: 8 males (106-122cm) and 5 females (71-134cm). Captures took place in depths of up to 20m and along 31km of the coast. Catch per unit of effort for the period July 1999-June 2001 indicated a higher mortality in autumn and in gillnets with 14cm stretched mesh size ('malha 14') Three franciscanas were captured and released alive from beach seine nets. Several fishing communities with similar operational methods along the southeastern coast of Brazil remain unmonitored. This suggests that franciscana mortality may be substantial on a regional basis and emphasizes the urgency of systematic monitoring.",A.,N.,Zerbini,,," ",,,C.,P.,Bertozzi,,,cpbertozzi@ig.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
164,"Incidental catches of franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) on the southern coast of São Paulo State and the coast of Paraná State, Brazil","A total of 40 individuals of P. blainvillei, incidentally caught on the southern coast of São Paulo State (region of Cananéia) (25°00'S, 47°54'W and 25°04'S, 47°56'W) and on the coast of Paraná State (25°18'S, 48°05'W and 25°58'S, 48°35'W), were recorded between 1997 and 1999. The average mortality of franciscanas incidentally caught by the only fishing boat sampled on the southern coast of São Paulo State, which operated up to 40 nautical miles (nm) from the coast, was 11 individuals/year, with a proportion of 2.3 males for every female. An average mortality of 10 franciscanas/year was estimated for several artisanal fishing communities sampled on the coast of Paraná State, where fishing activities usually are not further than 5nm from the coast. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) between the proportion of males and females incidentally caught by the artisanal fisheries on the Paraná coast. The proportion of sexually immature franciscanas reached 55%; in southern São Paulo State, compared with 76.2%; for the coast of Paraná. Bottom-set gillnets, with a stretched mesh size of 7.0 and 13.0cm, recorded the greatest number of individuals incidentally caught in the Cananéia region. However, on the Paraná coast, the greatest number of franciscanas was incidentally caught in driftnets with a stretched mesh size of 10.0cm. Comparing these mesh sizes with those presented in the literature for franciscanas incidentally caught in other places, it seems that other fishery characteristics (e.g. distance from the coast, depth, fishing effort, and season) are more important than the mesh size itself. The predominance of captured males in the fisheries further away from the coast, and the greatest proportion of sexually immature franciscanas incidentally caught in the fisheries closer to the coast, suggest spatial segregation between some age groups and sexes for this species in the study area. The results also suggest that the fisheries with industrial fishing characteristics, carried out by the boats in the Cananéia region, could be causing a strong impact on the populations of P. blainvillei. This means that a continuous surveillance of fishing activity is necessary for a greater period, including as many boats as possible, in order to certify the mortality estimates in that region.",M.,R.,Oliveira,,," ",,,E.,"L.

165,"Records of franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) from the coastal waters of São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil","Little is known about franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) in the coastal waters of São Paulo State (~23-25° S), Brazil. This is due to the lack of long-term research efforts directed towards this species. The data presented in this paper reflect the efforts of three research groups in collecting information from marine mammal stranding events along portions of São Paulo State coast. Data from 109 records, mostly of single stranding events (n=98), are presented. Ten individuals that were captured incidentally by gillnets were obtained from local fishermen. One calf was caught by a swimmer in shallow waters and released after four hours. The number of reported strandings was not evenly distributed throughout the year with more strandings being reported during summer, spring and winter months than in the autumn. Calves (n=28) were reported year-round with no significant seasonal differences. Six live strandings of calves were reported. Five of these calves died shortly after being held in small pools and one was released alive in coastal waters. Because of recent efforts in research and recovering of a relatively high number of dead animals, the easy accessibility to carcasses and local logistics, the central region of São Paulo State coast, known as 'Baixada Santista', offers the best potential to better develop P. blainvillei research.",S.,P.,Souza,,," ",,,F.,S.,Alvarenga,,," ",,,E.,,Zampirolli,,," ",,,A.,"F.

166,"Gillnets and conservation of the franciscana dolphin (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) in Argentina: a policy perspective","The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is the small cetacean species most frequently caught in inshore gillnet fisheries along the coasts of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. Within the franciscana's range in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the Cabo San Antonio (CSA) region of the Buenos Aires Province (BAP) in Argentina is an important and understudied location for observations on the species' interactions with the local artisanal gillnet fishery. Through interviews with fishermen, scientists, politicians and officers of the Prefectura Naval Argentina (Argentine Coast Guard, ACG) conducted in 1999 and 2000, this paper investigated the knowledge levels among these different groups about the franciscana and its interactions with the artisanal fishery, in order to develop new policy solutions to the species' high incidental mortality rate in gillnets and failing management regime. The results confirmed the suspected high entanglement rate. The artisanal fishermen were aware of the entanglement problem and reported capture levels, but expressed more concern about their economic stability and the immediate threats posed by overfishing of their target species. The need for coordinated management at the regional, national and international levels emerged as a persistent theme in the interviews, as did a need for education and formal cooperation over living marine resources. Given the current status of fishery and marine mammal laws in Argentina and the South Atlantic region; the widespread use of gillnets; the economics of the artisanal fishery, and the likelihood that sufficient ecological information about the species will not be known or available for many years, several immediate and protective measures to address these needs for the franciscana are suggested.",A.,M.,Arias,,," ",,,P.,,Bordino,,," ",,,H.,W.,Weiskel,,,weiskelh@pewoceans.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
167,"Assessment of the conservation status of a franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) stock in the Franciscana Management Area III following the IUCN Red List Process","The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the most widely followed and comprehensive inventory of the conservation status of species. Recently, the Red List programme changed in several ways including, revisions to the criteria for determining species' statuses and the development of a process for challenging statuses. In the 2000 Red List, the franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) was listed as 'Data Deficient', which indicates that data were insufficient to determine the status of the species under the Red List criteria but the species may be deemed to belong to a category of threat once adequate data for assessment are available. Because franciscana is possibly the cetacean species most impacted by anthropogenic activities, especially by incidental catches in gillnet fisheries in the western South Atlantic and because much data has accumulated over the last 15 years, all participants in the 4th Workshop for the Co-ordination of Research and Conservation of Franciscana in the Western South Atlantic (Porto Alegre, Brazil, 5-9 November, 2000) recommended that a reassessment of the species be performed as soon as possible. But due to the lack of the required information (from most regions) for assessment, the status of the species remains as 'Data Deficient'. However, in this paper, we assessed the conservation status of one franciscana stock inhabiting waters off Rio Grande do Sul State, southern Brazil and Uruguay (Franciscana Management Area III - FMA III). The available information for FMA III resulted in this stock being classified as 'Endangered' under sub-criterias 1d and 2d of criterion A (EN A1d+2d). The intention is to provide a case study (using the best known stock) to demonstrate the types of information and documentation required for a Red List assessment following the current criteria.",J.,Y.,Wang,,," ",,,E.,R.,Secchi,,,edu.secchi@xtra.co.nz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

169,"Status of semi-captive manatees in Jamaica","The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is one of the most endangered species in Jamaica. Four manatees were impounded at the Alligator Hole River on the south coast of the island since 1981. Their semi-captive status was unclear and the present study reports on the documentation of their gender and survival possibilities. The river was surveyed between 18-25 June 1991 by canoeing and snorkeling, interviews were conducted and photographs and documents were examined to ascertain their status, confirm their gender determination and to assess the circumstances of their capture. A total of 10 sightings were recorded, representing three different animals, all females. They were extremely evasive of humans, as they had been mistreated for long periods of time. Two of the animals appeared healthy, but one was observed with a severe cut in its caudal peduncle, produced by a rope and net. Given Jamaica's low manatee population numbers, and the observed degradation of the river, no justification exists to hold three reproducing female manatees apart from the rest of the Jamaican manatee gene pool. It is recommended that the manatees be captured and released at sea, after fitting them with satellite radio-transmitters, which will allow monitoring their re-adaptation to the wild.","M.

170,"Renal handling of water, urea and electrolytes in wild South America fur seal (<i>Arctocephalus australis</i>)","Fur seals alternate foraging at sea and fasting periods ashore. During fasting, energy and water are supplied by fat stores, but little is known about the transition from feeding to fasting metabolism. To evaluate the variation on land of significant parameters of urea and hydromineral metabolism, urine pH, plasma and urine osmolality, creatinine, urea, Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca2+ were determined in 65 wild South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) from Lobos Island, Uruguay. Urine/plasma ratio (U:P) and fractional excretion (FE) were calculated for creatinine, urea, Na+, K+, Cl- and Ca2+. As no significant differences were found between categories (immature, pregnant and non lactating, pregnant and lactating females, and immature males), pooled data allowed to perform correlation and regression tests. Correlated variables allow to characterize a post-absorptive (high FE of urea, urine urea and osmolality, associated with low U:P quotient for creatinine and urea) as well as fasting condition (low FE of urea, urine urea and osmolality, associated with high U:P quotient for creatinine and urea). The FE of urea versus log creatinine U:P plot suggests active urea secretion at low urine flows. Comparative urine analysis is consistent with a possible event of seawater ingestion in a young male: highest urine Na+ (336mmol l-1) and Cl-(265.74mmol l-1) concentrations associated with low urine urea concentration (657.24mmol l-1).",A.,E.,"Le Bas",,,lebas@fcien.edu.uy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
171,"Indexing seasonal abundance of humpback whales around Abrolhos Archipelago, Bahia, Brazil","The waters surrounding Abrolhos Archipelago, Brazil, serve as one of several winter grounds for southern-hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Development of tourism in this region has caused concern over disturbance effects to breeding and nursing whales. To document the chronology of humpback abundance around Abrolhos, three years of visual-scan data obtained during July through November 1998-2000 were analyzed. During 1-hour scans, observers visually tracked all groups within 9.3km and nearly 360° around a land-based theodolite station to determine group size, composition and behavior. Including only groups of known size, hourly counts (n=462) of adult and calf humpback whales ranged from 0-31 and 0-9, respectively. Group size could not be determined for 255 of 2146 groups observed. Humpback whale abundance was seasonal: there were few in early July when surveys began, peaked in early September, and then gradually declined to zero by late November. Based on Poisson regression, the annual chronology of whale occupancy was relatively invariant. Peak counts averaged about 15 adult whales per hour. Although no evidence was found that the timing of peak counts varied, peak abundance varied among years, and more whales were seen during morning than afternoon. The mean number of adults per group did not vary over time (year, day of year, or time of day), but the likelihood of group size being indeterminate varied predictably. Thus, indices of abundance could be adjusted by assuming that the size of indeterminate groups equals mean group size. Calf abundance varied with adult abundance, and the proportion of groups with calves increased from July through November. The high frequency of groups containing a calf (49.8%) within 9.3km of the Abrolhos Archipelago demonstrated the importance of this area for calves, and proper management is recommended.",M.,H.,Engel,,," ",,,A.,C.,Freitas,,," ",,,C.,"C.

172,"Distribution of pantropical spotted dolphins in Pacific coastal waters of Panama","Spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata) have been subjected to large removals as bycatch in the purse-seine tuna fishery. While pelagic stocks are relatively well known, information on coastal populations is scarce. This study attempted to quantify seasonal differences in the distribution of a coastal population in Bahía Honda, on the Pacific coast of Panama (7°50'N, 81°35'W). Field work (117 days) was conducted from January to June 2002. To analyse distribution, the study area was divided into a grid of 4.84km2 squares. Survey effort was logged by recording a GPS position every two minutes. Number of sightings in each square was divided by effort and corrected according to the proportion of sea/land. Dolphin presence and group size distribution were analysed using geostatistics and density contours were created through kriging. Only slight differences in distribution were detected between dry (Jan-Mar) and rainy (Apr-Jun) seasons. Dolphins preferred the area around Cativo bay, with a secondary core area next to Canales de Tierra Island. Encounters were rare towards Rosario bay. In general, sightings per unit effort seemed to be higher during the rainy season, although this may be a result of the dolphins getting used to the boat and improved observer experience. Group size was very variable, ranging from solitary animals to around 50 individuals with a median of 12 with no seasonal difference (U = 7142, p = 0.83). Most groups found in Bahía Honda (83.4%) contained fewer than ten individuals. This study, in conjunction with those elsewhere along the coastal eastern Pacific suggests that group size could be related to depth and/or to the presence/absence of the sympatric bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus. Further studies on biotic and abiotic correlates of dolphin distribution are needed, and information on potential prey, diet and feeding habits would help clarify the interspecific relationship with bottlenose dolphins.",S.,M.,Dawson,,," ",,,C.,,Garcia,,,garciaimhof@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
173,"Fraser's dolphin (<i>Lagenodelphis hosei</i> Fraser, 1956) in southern Brazil","The Fraser's dolphin, Lagenodelphis hosei Fraser, 1956, is distributed in tropical oceanic waters worldwide. There is little information on the biology and distribution of this species in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. From September to November 1997, 10 stranded Fraser's dolphins were collected along the northern Rio Grande do Sul coast, southern Brazil. The reproductive status was determined for seven animals; the sample was comprised mainly of sexually mature dolphins. Total length varied from 241.0 to 245.0cm for females and 216.0 to 258.0cm for males. Several fetal bones were found in the vaginal channel of one female. Analyses of stomach contents from six animals revealed remains of coastal species of cephalopods, fishes and crustaceans, suggesting that these dolphins were feeding nearshore prior to stranding. Five dolphins had large quantity of the parasite Phyllobotrium delphini (larval stage) in the blubber layer, particularly in the genital region. Although this species is considered to be tropical in distribution, the records from the Southwestern Atlantic are concentrated in temperate areas (30-35°S). Fraser's dolphin strandings in Rio Grande do Sul were not isolated events, and several other were recorded for the Brazilian, Uruguayan and Argentinean coast in the same and subsequent years. This may represent a complex phenomenon involving several causes, such as transient oceanographic events, diseases and other variables.",L.,R.,Oliveira,,," ",,,"G.

178,"Reproduction of female franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil","In this paper, the reproductive biology of female franciscanas (Pontoporia blainvillei) is described based on a sample of 97 individuals collected in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Data were collected from dolphins incidentally by-caught by the commercial fleet of Rio Grande and Tramandaí or stranded in the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul. Age was estimated by counting the growth layer groups present in the dentin and cementum of the teeth. The female reproductive status was determined through the analysis of the ovaries, mammary glands and uterus. The large majority of the recorded ovulations occurred in the left ovary (88%). There was no evidence that the corpus luteum (CL) increases its size as gestation progresses, and there is a considerable individual variation in CL size in females of different stages of pregnancy. The reproduction of the franciscana is markedly seasonal and the species present a typical birth-pulse pattern in Rio Grande do Sul. Births begin abruptly in October and decrease gradually until February. Length and weight at birth was estimated at 73.4cm and 6.1kg, respectively, and the gestation period lasts 11.2 months. Mating and conception should occur between November and March. Sexual maturity in females is attained between 2 and 5 years. Estimation of mean age at sexual maturity was calculated as 3.7 years (CI 95%=3.0–4.4 years) by the DeMaster method and 3.5 years by the logistic equation. Length and weight at sexual maturity were 138.9cm (CI 95%=132.8-145.1) and 32.8kg (CI 95%=29.9-35.7), respectively. Annual pregnancy rate in Rio Grande do Sul was estimated to be 0.66, with a calving interval of 1.5 years. Due to its low age at sexual maturity, short calving interval and brief lifespan, the franciscana is one of the cetacean species with the fastest life history traits. There is no evidence of reproductive senescence and franciscanas seem to remain reproductively active throughout life.",D.,,Danilewicz,,,daniel.danilewicz@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
179,"Interactions between gillnet fisheries and small cetaceans in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: 2001-2002","In northern Rio de Janeiro (21°18'S-22°25'S), Brazil, gillnets are responsible for the by-catch of a number of small cetaceans. Franciscanas (Pontoporia blainvillei) and marine tucuxis (Sotalia fluviatilis) are the most impacted species. From November 2001 to October 2002 data on fisheries and mortality of small cetaceans were obtained through interviews with fishermen of 20% of the gillnet fleet. Seasons were grouped into spring-summer and autumn-winter and the region was divided into two fishing areas: Area I (Barra do Itabapoana to São Tomé Cape) and Area II (São Tomé Cape to Macaé). A total of 374 gillnet operations were recorded between 0.02-42.1n.miles from shore and in waters 5-67m deep. Gillnets were 3.1m in length and of 120mm mesh size. The fishing effort for the entire fleet (n=50 boats) was estimated at 7,161.8km of net and the total number of small cetaceans caught was 225. The CPUE was 0.031 animal × (km of net × day)-1. Fisheries and by-catches did not show seasonal differences. Fishing trips were more prevalent in Area I, whereas the by-catch of franciscanas and marine tucuxis was higher in Area II. Fisheries were distributed uniformly in areas close to shore (first 10n.miles) and beyond. In Area I they occurred predominantly within the 30-m isobath. The by-catch of franciscanas and marine tucuxis also occurred within these limits, suggesting that 30-m isobath may constitute the offshore limit of their distribution along the coast. The variability in the width of the continental shelf in Areas I and II may explain the differences in the magnitude of the by-catch of small cetaceans in these areas. Gillnet fisheries may adversely impact the coastal populations of small cetaceans. In northern Rio de Janeiro, particularly between 22°00'S and 22°25'S where the 30-m isobath is found close to shore, fisheries operating within the first 10n.miles from shore can pose substantial threat to dolphins. Due to the distribution of their preferred prey,  franciscanas may be at greater risk of by-catch in areas near the Paraíba do Sul river mouth. It is thus proposed that these areas be closed to gillnet fisheries year round, so that the impact on coastal dolphins is minimised.",A.,"P.

180,"Preliminary estimate of incidental mortality of Commerson's dolphins (<i>Cephalorhynchus commersonii</i>) in an artisanal setnet fishery in La Angelina Beach and Ría Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Argentina","The Commerson's dolphin, Cephalorhynchus commersonii, is perhaps the cetacean species most impacted by fisheries in the coastal waters of southern South America, south of 41°S. Between January 1999 and February 2000, 66 Commerson's dolphins were found dead on the coasts of La Angelina and Ría Gallegos, and at least 37 of the ones at La Angelina beach (51°20'S, 069°02'W) were caught incidentally. These captures occurred in gill nets that were set in waters shallower than 15m and mainly for Patagonian blenny (Eleginops maclovinus), silversides (Odonthestes nigricans) and parona leatherjack (Parona signata). The season for set net fishing, extending from the end of August to mid February, overlaps with the breeding season (November-February) of Commerson's dolphins, which is also when this species moves inshore. The estimated catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for gillnets in the area of La Angelina was 0.229 dolphins x (1,000m of net x set)-1. By extrapolation, the estimated total by-catch during the 1999/2000 fishing season in the region of La Angelina and Ría Gallegos was 179 dolphins (SD = 18.8; CI = 141 - 212). Although no abundance estimation of Commerson's dolphins in this region is available, the estimated level of bycatch is concerning. Recommendations for action to mitigate and further document the impact of set gillnets are presented.",E.,R.,Secchi,,," ",,,A.,L.,Tomsin,,," ",,,C.,,Gasparrou,,," ",,,M.,,Hevia,,," ",,,M.,A.,Iñíguez,,,tovera@sanjulian.com.ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
181,"Morphometrical categorization of <i>Phyllobothrium delphini</i> (Cestoidea, Tetraphyllidea) cysts from Fraser's dolphin, <i>Lagenodelphis hosei</i> (Cetacea, Delphinidae)","The larvae of phyllobothriid cestode worms found in marine mammals have been classified as either ""delphinii group"" or ""grimaldii group"". The first group has been divided into 11 morphotypes by previous studies. However, these categories are vague and often overlap, as they were described from different host species within a wide geographical range. The goal of this study is to simplify the categorization of larval shape and size based on samples obtained from a single host species. Eleven Fraser's dolphin Lagenodelphis hosei Fraser, 1956 stranded on the coast of Uruguay in November 2001 and subsequently died. From these animals, 190 cysts of Phyllobothrium delphini (Bosc, 1802) were obtained from the perigenital blubber of one female and one male. The prevalence of P. delphini was 18.18%, density was 159.38 larvae/kg of perigenital blubber, mean intensity was 95 and mean abundance was 17.27. The following measurements were taken: total length (BL), width and thickness of cysts, neck length (NL), scolex length, scolex width, external diameter of the suckers, and the ratio BL/NL. In order to facilitate further identification of these phyllobothriid cysts, they were grouped into three categories according to shape and size: category ""A"" (22.35%, neck always straight); category 'B' (62.35%, all with curved neck); category 'C' (15.30%, U-shaped or with projections from the wall of the cyst, also curved neck). These morphological differences could correlate to time spent in the host. One other larval form (Tetrabothrius sp.) was also found in the blubber of these dolphins.",A.,E.,"Le Bas",,," ",,,G.,,"Failla Siquier",,,gfailla@fcien.edu.uy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

188,"Dental anomalies in the atlantic population of south american sea lion, <i>Otaria byronia</i> (Pinnipedia, Otariidae): evolutionary implications and ecological approach","We analyzed 63 cases of dental anomalies from 62 specimens of a total sample of 516 specimens of the Atlantic population of South American sea lions, Otaria byronia de Blainville, 1820. The anomalies were represented by 53 cases of missing upper post-canine 6 (second molars), seven cases of maxillary or mandibular extra teeth, two cases of 'dentes geminatis'; and one case of reduced teeth. Considering a phylogenetic framework where all otariid species and basal Pinnipedimorpha are included, missing post-canine 6 could be related to evolutionary trends in Otariidae towards a progressive reduction and loss of teeth (agenesis). The occurrence of the upper post-canine 6 in Otaria Péron, 1816 as in Phocarctos Peters, 1866 is usually regarded as a primitive character. Alternatively, when adopting another cladistic procedure, this could be interpreted as a taxic atavism at the base of Otaria/Phocarctos clade. Extra-mandibular teeth are related to a concrete case of spontaneous atavism in the dentition of Otaria byronia, in retrogression to ancient groups like the Miocene pinnipediform Pteronarctos Barnes, 1989. The other anomalies - maxillary extra teeth, 'dentes geminati'; and reduced teeth - are caused by some disturbance on the epigenetic system underlying dental morphogenesis leading to duplication, coalescence or duplication and reduction of the dental germ, respectively. Dental formula in Otaria byronia shows a high degree of variability and this variability must be considered in the light of their phylogenetic relationships and their evolutionary history. The ecological approach suggests that dental anomalies do not affect longevity, and are unrelated to dietary items or environmental disturbances, but these points need more careful studies.",J.,O.,Menegheti,,," ",,,M.,E.,Fabián,,," ",,,C.,J.,Drehmer,,,cjaeger@terra.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

Measurements of the angle of the crown on canine teeth (method 1) and measurements of the crown and root on canines (method 2) were compared with the purpose of evaluating which method is more reliable in sex estimation. Stepwise discriminant analysis showed that method 2 was the most reliable. Discriminant functions for upper and lower canines were obtained for males and females where sex was known. Discriminant functions were also obtained for all canines according to the physical maturity of skull (physically immature and physically mature).",M.,C.,Pinedo,,," ",,,D.,,Molina-Schiller,,,daniza@marinemammals.cl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
190,"Assessment of the level of surface activity in humpback whales during the breeding season","Between 1991 and 2002, the reproductive behavior of the humpback whale was studied during the breeding season off the coast of Ecuador, South America (02°S, 81°W). During the sighting period the level of surface activity exhibited by the whales was assessed according to the type of display performed and its frequency. Five displays that produce percussion sounds and used likely for communication were considered: breaching, head-lapping, tail-slapping, flipper-slapping and tail slashing. A total of 289 selected sightings were included in one of four levels according to a scale of intensity designed for the purpose. To determine what social conditions increased or reduced the activity, groups were organized according to their size and age-class composition. Singletons and groups of three and four whales showed a significantly higher surface activity than pairs or larger than four for the highest intensity level (P<0.05). Differences were also found when age-classes were compared, with subadults showing significantly higher surface activity than other classes (P<0.01). Groups that increased members showed a significant difference respect to decreasing groups at the lowest level of intensity of the scale (P<0.05). Competitive groups showed a significant higher occurrence at intensity level 2 than other groups (P<0.05). No relationship was found between whale speed and surface activity. The possible influence of environment factors such as day hour, sea state, moon phase and 'El Niño', was also assessed; none of which showed a clear trend to affect the intensity of whale surface activity. A discussion about the implications of these findings is provided as well as interpretations of possible meanings of some displays under different social contexts. This analysis indicates that social aspects rather than environment factors drive the surface activity of the humpback whales during the breeding season.",F.,,Félix,,,fernandofelix@femm.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
191,"Home ranges and movement patterns of the marine tucuxi dolphin, <i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i>, in Baía Norte, southern Brazil","Marine tucuxi dolphins (Sotalia fluviatilis) studied in Baía Norte, southern Brazil, exhibited very small overall home ranges with daylight movements in consistent water depths of around 3m. Mean overall home range areas calculated through two methodologies were similar, measuring 13.38km ± 1.92 using the Minimum Convex Polygon method and 15.22km ± 0.66 through the kernel estimator. Mean core areas calculated by kernel were extremely small [mean = 1.49km at 50% UD (utilization distribution) and 0.87km at 25% UD levels]. The geographical distributions of home ranges and core areas overlapped extensively at both 50% UD and 25% UD. Daylight movements ranged from 0.16 to 28.97 km/day (mean = 5.65 ± 0.56km/day, SD = 5.36) with mean minimum rate of movement of 2.6 ± 0.2km/h (SD = 2.02). Daylight movement patterns varied seasonally with higher values of distance moved and rate of movement in winter and winter and autumn, respectively. The marine tucuxi home ranges and daylight movement patterns presented here are smaller than much of what is known for other coastal small cetaceans. The percentage of overall home range within the limits of a protected area designated for the tucuxis could be considered moderate to high depending on the estimator used (54.06% or 5.9km by MCP and 74.71% or 11.35km using the kernel). Nevertheless, core areas are completely within the protected area. Conservation implications of these findings include the need to: (i) create a buffer zone to the south of the existing protected area which will encompass the overall home range of the tucuxis; (ii) establish constant, adequate enforcement of fishery and boat traffic regulations in the core areas; and (iii) regulate boat traffic and aquaculture farming in important areas which are not yet subject to specific regulations.",M.,,Bazzalo,,," ",,,P.,"A.

192,"Preliminary observations on habitat use patterns of the marine tucuxi, <i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i>, in Cispatá Bay, Colombian Caribbean coast","Some aspects of the habitat use of Sotalia fluviatilis were monitored in the Cispatá Bay and adjacent coastal waters on the Atlantic coast of Colombia, from November 1996 to August 1997. Dolphins were seen on 119 occasions during 1087.5 effort hours. They were present throughout the year, but entered the bay more often during the dry season, from December to April (&Chi; = 262.42, p < 0.05). Most of their time was spent feeding (54%) and travelling/feeding (23%). Travelling and travelling/feeding decreased respectively from 21% to 14%, and from 41% to 6% during the rainy season. We interpreted this change in behaviour as dolphins spending more time searching for food during the dry season. S. fluviatilis entered the bay in groups of about ten individuals (SD = 8.6) and stayed within the bay for about 81.5 minutes (SD = 57.9). Dolphin presence was significantly higher during the morning than in the afternoon (H = 11.7; p < 0.05). In general, no preferential area within the bay was observed, but a seasonal difference in time spent in different zones was detected. We suggest that habitat use patterns depend mainly on resource availability and distribution. Boat traffic was significantly higher during the tourist season (t = 4.1, p < 0.05), but dolphin presence was independent of boat traffic (&Chi; = 0.002, p = 0.96). They did not avoid high traffic zones, but they changed their behaviour or the direction of movement in the presence of boats in six out of nine occasions. The main pressures on the local population of S. fluviatilis were identified as: 1) High speed boat traffic inside the bay. 2) Accidental mortality in fishing gears. 3) Indirect pressure from fisheries that have depleted the marine resources and have caused habitat degradation.",F.,,Trujillo,,," ",,,C.,,García,,,garciaimhof@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
193,"Incidental catches of franciscana in coastal gillnet fisheries in the Franciscana Management Area III: period 1999-2000","Bycatch of franciscanas in fishing operations along the western South Atlantic Ocean has been observed for approximately 60 years. Reports on bycatch in shark gillnet fisheries off Uruguay date back to the early 1940s. A decade later, gillnet fisheries for bottom-dwelling fish became the major conservation concern for franciscanas in both Brazil and Argentina. A small portion (c. 10%), of the coastal gillnet fleet which operate from the port of Rio Grande (southern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) was monitored in 1999-2000. The total annual bycatch was estimated to be 946 franciscanas (non-parametric CI = 467 - 1525) for the year 1999 and 719 (non-parametric CI = CI: 248 - 1413) dolphins for 2000. The total bycatch for the whole FMA III was 1106 (CI: 578 - 1915) for 1999 and 992 (CI: 475 - 1832) for 2000. Since data were not normally distributed confidence intervals were estimated by non-parametric bootstrap. Despite strong evidence of decline for the stock from FMA III, no mitigation strategy has been established or designed. Instead, fishing effort is still very high, it is increasing and bycatch is uncontrolled. Thus, prompt management action is required. Regulation of gillnet fishing effort might be the only suitable immediate action to mitigate the bycatch.",M.,,Muelbert,,," ",,,P.,G.,Kinas,,," ",,,E.,R.,Secchi,,,edu.secchi@furg.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

From 1981 through 2002 an extensive research was performed to collect information about stranding of manatees of the northeast coast of Brazil. Data were separated in two distinct periods (1981-1990 and 1991-2002) and analyzed according to specific categories: stranded dead (captured by nets, captured by harpoons and undefined cause) and stranded alive (dead in captivity and captive population). There were 74 events of stranding manatees in the period surveyed. Thirty-one events of dead manatees and 43 events of specimens that survived until December, 2002 were recorded. In the last years of the study there were more strandings of live animals than dead. The main reason for the strandings of manatee calves in northeastern Brazil is the separation from their mothers. The largest numbers of stranded manatees occurred in Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte states.",R.,P.,Lima,,," ",,,J.,E.,Vergara-Parente,,," ",,,C.,L.,Parente,,,crparente@pop.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

These were analyzed to explore aspects of the cranial development. The growth layers groups (GLGs) in the dentine and cementum from upper canine teeth were counted. The oldest male and female were 14 and 18 years of age, respectively. Parameters of the von Bertalanffy equation suggest that males and females attain physical maturity at about the eight and six years of age, respectively. Hotelling T test and discriminant functions using metric characters showed sexual dimorphism in physically mature and immatures skulls. The developmental classes were also examined using non-metric characters, but no sexual dimorphism was observed using these variables. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation between physically mature skulls of males and females. The first factor explained 80.2% of the total variation and the second factor explained 4.6% of the observed variability.

200,"Growth layer patterns in <i>Arctocephalus australis</i> canine teeth: evaluation of techniques for age determination","A total of 75 canine teeth from 27 A. australis (13 males and 14 females) were examined. The animals were found dead from 1977 to 1997 on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Growth Layer Groups (GLGs) in each canine were compared and examined for age determination using four techniques. These four techniques were evaluated according to the visible number of GLGs in dentine and cementum (techniques 2, 3 and 4) or external rings (technique 1). Technique 4 (decalcified and stained thin section) was the best technique for age determination in A. australis, as it showed the highest conspicuousness of the growth layers (GLGs and accessory layers) in dentine and cementum (especially in old exemplars with pulp cavity closed). Technique 3 (half-tooth etched in 5% formic acid and rubbed with graphite powder) was selected as second best, and recommended for use in dentine counts up to 10 GLGs in males and 6 GLGs in females. Technique 1 (external rings on canine root) offered easy readings until approximately the seventh ring, beyond which misreadings in age determination occurred. Technique 2 (thick unstained and undecalcified sections) presented limitations for obtaining sections of the same thickness compromising a good reading of the GLGs. This in turn could influence the resolution of the growth layers, as the GLGs reading in dentine and cementum were more difficult in this technique than in technique 4.",M.,C.,Pinedo,,," ",,,D.,,Molina-Schiller,,,daniza@marinemammals.cl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
201,"Overlap between pinniped summer diet and artisanal fishery catches in Uruguay","The similarity of the trophic ecology of Arctocephalus australis and Otaria flavescens in Uruguay was studied to help understand a possible trophic competition between the two species and its relation with artisanal fisheries. Dietary data for both pinnnipeds together with artisanal fisheries catch data were analyzed to estimate the overlap in prey species and sizes. Diet overlap was very high (Colwell and Futuyma overlap index, C = 0.80), with three fish species (Anchoa marinii, Cynoscion guatucupa, and Trichiurus lepturus) comprising more than 90% of the total number of individuals consumed by both species. In addition, the length of these three fish prey taken by fur seals and sea lions was similar, suggesting a large overlap not only in species but also in the size of prey ingested. The main difference between the two pinniped diets was that O. flavescens showed a more diverse diet than A. australis. Concerning pinniped fisheries interactions, a low level of overlap was observed between the diet of each pinniped and artisanal fisheries catches (C = 0.22 for O. flavescens, and C = 0.09 for A. australis). Possibly, sea lion diet is broader than artisanal fisheries catches. Length comparisons for C. guatucupa, the only species well represented in both pinniped species diet and fisheries catches, indicated that individuals taken by the latter were larger than those consumed by the pinnipeds. However, the use of different age classes of the same resource, at different times or spatial locations do not imply less intensity of the interaction.",M.,,Arim,,," ",,,D.,E.,Naya,,," ",,,D.,,Szteren,,,dszteren@ipn.mx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
202,"Cetacean remains and strandings in the Galápagos Islands, 1923-2003","A compilation of data on cetacean remains and strandings found on the shores of the Galápagos Islands, eastern equatorial Pacific, for the period 1923-2003 is presented. Information is available for 87 records belonging to 13 species. Four species account for 71% of the records: Tursiops truncatus, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Delphinus delphis, and Ziphius cavirostris. Visitor sites and the vicinity of population centers yielded most of the records; no other geographic pattern was evident in the strandings. The stranding record reflects the odontocete communities of nearshore and upwelling environments in the Galápagos. Morphometric and meristic measurements are presented for 17 skulls belonging to T. truncatus, Stenella attenuata, D. delphis, and S. coeruleoalba. The measurements for T. truncatus are consistent with the offshore ecotype, although in the Galápagos the species predominantly occupies the nearshore environment. The stomach contents of a young Z. cavirostris included seven species of cephalopod and two crustaceans. Mass strandings of Z. cavirostris (n=2) and G. macrorhynchus (n=2) have been witnessed and documented, while remains of multiple individuals found together on the beach suggest additional mass strandings of Pseudorca crassidens, S. attenuata, T. truncatus, and G. macrorhynchus.

The study was carried out along 30km of coast, divided into rocky and sandy shores. During the study period we responded to calls from the public about dead stranded marine mammals (SMM), and from March 1999 to December 2001 the coast was also monitored (211km total effort). A total of 153 SMM (90 from notifications, 63 from beach monitoring) from nine different species were recorded: 76% (n=117) were California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), the most abundant pinniped on the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula. Adult males stranded more often than other age and sex classes (P<0.05). The highest frequency of California sea lion strandings was located on sandy beaches (p<0.05) because carcasses may be deposited and remain more easily there than on rocky beaches. The 1998 El Niño event influenced stranding frequencies; most SMM were recorded during that year. As to seasons of the year, most SMM were recorded during spring; this may indicate a higher abundance of marine mammals in the area during this part of the year. Probable human-induced injuries were observed in 17% (n=26) of all animals. Most of these were Z. californianus (n=24), probably due to their known interaction with fisheries; 70% were males.",R.,,Escobar-Fernández,,," ",,,Y.,,Schramm,,," ",,,G.,,Heckel,,,gheckel@cicese.mx,,,E.,,Bravo,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

Differences in size and shape of skulls of 386 adult males and females of A. australis from Uruguayan and Peruvian populations were analyzed using 15 linear measurements. These differences were also investigated applying geometric morphometrics techniques to two-dimensional images of 346 skulls in dorsal, ventral and lateral views. Results of traditional and geometric morphometrics revealed pronounced sexual dimorphism in size and shape of the skull for both populations of A. australis. Males are always larger than females, and differences in shape are concentrated mainly in the rostral region. Sexual dimorphism is more accentuated in the Uruguayan population. Differences in size and shape of the skulls between males and females of A. australis can be related to sexual selection, mating system and life history. In A. australis, as well as in other polygynous species, the selective pressures can favor the development of traits that enhance fighting ability in males, such as larger canines, increased rostral and mastoid widths and increased overall body size.",J.,S.,Morgante,,," ",,,E.,,Hingst-Zaher,,," ",,,L.,R.,Oliveira,,,lari_minuano@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
212,"Recent rapid increases in the right whale (<i>Eubalaena australis</i>) population off southern Brazil","Right whales (Eubalaena australis) that gather on a wintering ground off southern Brazil have been aerial surveyed and photographically identified since 1987. As of 2003 the Brazilian Right Whale Catalogue has 315 different individual whales of which 31 were resighted in other years (23 females, 3 yearlings and 5 whales of unknown age/sex). No resightings occurred prior to 1994 and 71% (n=24) were recorded in 2003. The modal observed interval between calving events is 3 years, consistent with successful reproduction. From 1997 to 2003 the number of reproductive females in the Central Survey Area off Brazil increased at a rate of 29.8% per year (95% CL 15.7, 44.0), and at 14% per year (95% CL 7.1, 20.9) from 1987 to 2003. These rates are significantly different from zero (t=4.133, p<0.009 and t=4.06, p<0.004, respectively). The increase from 1997 to 2003 is higher than the rates observed for right whales in other wintering grounds in the South Atlantic. The right whales on the Brazilian wintering ground are not just transients. Ten percent of the whales have been resighted. If the number of whales continues to increase they will probably expand their distribution throughout their historical 2,400 km range and come into increasing conflict with human activities.",M.,E.,Fabian,,," ",,,F.,R.,Adler,,," ",,,P.,"A.

We conducted opportunistic surveys in Gandoca-Manzanillo (9°36'N, 82°35'W), Costa Rica. Of the 71 groups analyzed, 46.5% were comprised only of tucuxis, 21.1% of bottlenose dolphins, and 32.4% of the two species. Social behavior was more frequent in mixed-species groups and in groups larger than four dolphins; foraging was more frequent in single-species groups and in groups smaller than five dolphins. Photographic documentation and sightings of putative hybrids suggest the occurrence of hybridization between both dolphin species. Results indicate that tucuxis and bottlenose dolphins interacted frequently and that these interactions were predominantly social in nature. Future studies will discern whether these interactions result in the development of hybrids.",A.,,DiBerardinis,,," ",,,S.,,Larkin,,," ",,,K.,,Larkin,,," ",,,P.,,Forestell,,," ",,,A.,,Acevedo-Gutiérrez,,,acevedo@biol.wwu.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
214,"Whale mortality from ship strikes in Ecuador and West Africa","We document two unusual cases of a Bryde's and a sei whale struck by container cargo vessels and draped over the bow bulb, respectively in the Southeast Pacific and the Eastern Tropical Atlantic. The 207m-length P&O Nedlloyd Pantanal collided with an adult Bryde's whale Balaenoptera edeni in the southern Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador, on 10 December 2004. The whale showed massive dermal hematoma indicating that it was alive when struck. Similarly, the container ship OSNA Bruck arrived at Dakar port, Senegal, on 19 March 1998 with the fresh carcass of a juvenile sei whale B. borealis on its bow bulb. The collision occurred between Las Palmas, Gran Canaria and Dakar, Senegal. Freshly dead balaenopterids can hardly be picked up by ships since they sink at death and do not float until decomposition and bloating sets in. A review of previous cases show that ship strikes are rarely recorded in these regions, partly due to the lack of regulations, including no reporting obligation. However, the case studies reveal that another factor may severely augment under-reporting of ship strike mortality. In both instances the crew became aware of the collision only upon arrival at port, suggesting that whales which are hit and killed or wounded, but do not become draped over the bow bulb (if the vessel has one), go unnoticed. The probability of bow draping may be low, and modelling should be attempted. National authorities are encouraged to improve data collection and introduce regulations such as mandatory reporting. These are the first fully documented, fatal whale collisions in Ecuador and West Africa (south of the Canary Islands), and the first struck and killed Bryde's whale in the Southeast Pacific.",F.,,Félix,,,fernandofelix@femm.org,,,K.,,"Van Waerebeek",,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
215,"Training of Antillean manatee <i>Trichechus manatus manatus</i> Linnaeus, 1758 as a management technique for individual welfare","Behavioral training is a method used in institutions that keep captive animals to assist in husbandry and health assessment issues. It consists of training animals using positive reinforcement to perform behaviors that facilitate veterinary procedures without the use of physical restraint or drugs, thereby improving animal welfare. A female Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus), eight years old, weighing approximately 400kg and measuring 266cm, was the subject of this study. The training method used was operant conditioning with positive reinforcement, which encourages the animal to cooperate during veterinary inspections. The animal was trained that every time it performed a commanded behavior correctly, it would be rewarded with food and verbal praise. Furthermore, just prior to the moment of the reward a whistle was sounded; thus the animal associated this sound with the correct performance of the commanded behavior. To control the body position, the animal was trained by operant conditioning to touch a target. Our subject was trained in two stages, to perform necessary behaviors to collect biological samples (e.g. blood). Some of the possible factors influencing the training sessions were evaluated, such as the identity of the keeper, the impact of sounds and the number of days between training sessions. Only the identity of the keeper was found to influence training sessions. Our subject rapidly learned to express a number of commanded behavior patterns to assist its management in captivity. Therefore we consider this method to have been successful. We consider this method as indispensable when managing large endangered species in captivity, as training reduces stress for the animal and reduces risk to its human caregivers Finally, the application of this method will allow us to collect more biological data about this endangered species.",D.,S.,Lima,,,limadanielle@terra.com.br,,,J.,E.,Vergara-Parente,,," ",,,R.,J.,Young,,," ",,,E.,,Paszkiewicz,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

218,"A southern bottlenose whale examined in the Antarctic","This paper mainly concerns the dissection of a lactating female southern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon planifrons especially shot and worked up for the author in the Antarctic 61°09'S, 86°44'E on 10 March 1948. The skeleton is in the British Museum (Natural History). A comparison with what is known of the female northern bottlenose whale H. ampullatus shows no differences in morphometry, body colour, external characters, digestive system and reproductive system, parasites and the vertebral formula and the digital formula of the flipper. There remain acknowledged differences in the skull which may be reduced or perhaps even disappear when further comparisons are attempted between skulls from males and females of similar ages. There is also the confusion when identifying ziphiid whales at sea. These observations have suggested to the author that there may be only one Hyperoodon species with a continuous distribution north and south. But Dalebout et al. (2004), applying DNA sequencies in molecular taxonomy, have now shown that all 21 species of ziphiid whales are valid.","R.

219,"An Andrew's beaked whale <i>Mesoplodon bowdoini</i> (Cetacea, Ziphiidae) stranded on the Atlantic Coast of Uruguay","On 24 May 2003, a fresh dead specimen of Andrew's beaked whale was found stranded at La Coronilla beach (33°54'50""S, 53°30'15""W), Department of Rocha, Uruguay. Morphological and osteological characters were used to identify the specimen and genetic analyses confirmed the species identification. Although basic body morphology was consistent with published descriptions, the Uruguayan specimen exhibited subadult characteristics, in spite of its total length (430cm), typical of an adult male. The color pattern differed from the previously described for a male of this species, being more similar to an adult female M. carlhubbsi. Its CBL (800mm) was beyond the reported range for the species (645-783mm), making it the largest known skull for M. bowdoini. The teeth were similar to those of an adult female M. bowdoini, being very small in relation to CBL and total length. Pulp cavity was partially closed and the crowns were erupted 9mm from the gum with no signs of wear. This study provides the first indication of accelerated growth in M. bowdoini and shows data on a specimen with an intermediate development status. The antorbital notch is more bulky and solid than the antorbital notches of New Zealand and Australian M. bowdoini. The jugal extended into the antorbital notch as occurs in most specimens and is more developed and more similar in form to that of M. carlhubbsi. This is the first occurrence of M. bowdoini on the Uruguayan coast and the northernmost record for the species in the Atlantic Ocean.","A. ",,"Le Bas",,," ",,,"P.

220,"Biological data on two Hector's beaked whales, <i>Mesoplodon hectori</i>, stranded in Buenos Aires province, Argentina","Beaked whales or ziphiids are the least known cetaceans, and are among the least studied of all mammalian groups. In August and September of 2002, a male and a female beaked whale stranded alive on the Argentine coast, 110km away from each other. The specimens died shortly after the stranding and their bodies were collected for dissection and analysis. The specimens were identified as belonging to the genus Mesoplodon. Further measurements of the skulls, shape and location of teeth as well as molecular analyses of the mtDNA control region and cytochrome b, allowed unambiguous identification of both specimens as Hector's beaked whale, Mesoplodon hectori. The color pattern was different between male and female. Standard length was 3.94 meters for the male and 3.84 meters for the female. The female's vertebral formula was C7 + T10 + L11 + Ca21 = 49. Histo-pathological analysis of the female revealed the presence of Sarcocystis sp. in the skeletal muscle, and lung lesions related to parasitic damage and pneumonia or chronic infection. The stomach of both individuals was empty. The digestive tract of both specimens was infected by larval stages L4 of Anisakis sp. The female was also infected by Tetrabothrius sp. and  Bolbosoma sp. while Braunina cordiformis was only found in the male. Different composition of parasitic fauna suggests possible sex-related differences in the diet or individual variability. Total length, teeth eruption (in the male) and the degree of vertebral epiphyses fusion suggest that both individuals were mature.","A. ",,Saubidet,,," ",,,"A. ",,Gianggiobe,,," ",,,"P.

222,"Oceanographic conditions off coastal South America in relation to the distribution of Burmeister's porpoise, <i>Phocoena spinipinnis</i>","Historical data (1965-2000) of temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (0 and 50m) were analyzed to understand the seasonal variability of the oceanographic conditions associated to the distribution of P. spinipinnis from Paita, Peru (05°01'S, 81°W), in the Pacific Ocean, to Santa Catarina, Brazil (28°48'S, 49°12'W), in the Atlantic. The variability of historical average data was associated with different processes as a function of the geographical position and seasonality. These variations have different expressions along each coast as a function of the circulation system in each ocean. The northern boundary of the distribution of P. spinipinnis for the Pacific coast at Paita (5°S) is coincident with the westward turn of the Humboldt Current, as it is incorporated into the South Equatorial Current. In the Atlantic, the northern boundary for the species seems to be associated with the Atlantic Subtropical Convergence (30-40°S). The high temperature (<24°C) and salinities (<36psu) registered at the surface and at 50m between the coast and 20nm were coincident with the known northern limit of the distribution of this species on both coasts of South America. We propose the existence of three oceanographic areas within the distributional range of P. spinipinnis: (1) from Paita, Peru to south of Arauco Gulf, Chile, that has the influence of the Humboldt Current, and a developed oxygen minimum zone (OMZ); (2) from south of Arauco Gulf to south of La Plata River, Argentina, which shows the influence of the Cape Horn and Malvinas Currents, respectively, as well as downwelling processes, freshwater contributions from fjords, glaciers and rivers; and (3) from La Plata River to Santa Catarina, Brazil, which is characterized by the influence of the Brazil Current, and the freshwater contributions of the basin of La Plata River and the estuarine system of Patos Lagoon, south Brazil. The presence of the OMZ is possibly a factor in the separation of groups (1) and (2) along in the Chilean coast. In addition, we propose that Burmeister's porpoise presents a continuous distribution throughout this range from Paita, Peru to La Plata River basin, Argentina, being able to reach Uruguayan and Brazilian waters under certain oceanographic conditions (intrusion of colder and less saline waters toward the north associated with the Subtropical Convergence).",T.,"R.

223,"Composition and seasonal variation in the diet of the South American sea lion (<i>Otaria flavescens</i>) from Quequén, Argentina","Diet seasonality in South American sea lions, Otaria flavescens, was studied using 252 scats from a male-exclusive haul-out site located in Puerto Quequén (38°37'S, 58°50'W) Argentina during 2001. Prey species were identified from hard remains and their relative importance was assessed considering frequency of occurrence, abundance and biomass. The main prey consumed by sea lions were teleost fish (20 species), followed by cephalopods (four species) and crustaceans. The raneya, Raneya fluminensis, was the most frequent prey year-round, and the most abundant in autumn and winter. The Argentine anchovy, Engraulis anchoita, and the stripped weakfish, Cynoscion guatucupa, were the most abundant prey in spring and summer, respectively. Seasonal differences in the sizes consumed were only found for C. guatucupa. The sea lions from Puerto Quequén showed a diverse diet, mainly feeding on demersal and pelagic prey. Our study fills a geographical gap on the seasonal variation of the diet of South American sea lions. Two main patterns emerged from studies conducted along the geographic range of the species: (1) O. flavescens is a generalist and opportunist feeder, preying on a wide range of species; mainly those of pelagic and demersal habits, (2) South American sea lions change the frequency and/or specific composition of their diet seasonally, possibly as a result of changes in the relative availability of each species in the environment.",H.,L.,Capozzo,,,cappozzo@macn.gov.ar,,,M.,H.,Cassini,,," ",,,D.,,Sanfelice,,," ",,,A.,A.,Suarez,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
224,"Natural and human disturbance in a rookery of the California sea lion (<i>Zalophus californianus californianus</i>) in the Gulf of California, Mexico","Los Islotes is the southernmost breeding site of the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus californianus) in the Northern Hemisphere and represents one of the principal tourist attractions for the city of La Paz, Mexico. The tourism has been growing without control and could be the cause of perturbation in the reproductive and haul-out patterns of the sea lion. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of tourism activities on the behavior of sea lions, in order to help design regulations to assure better use and conservation of the site. The nature and intensity of tourism activity and sea lion behavior were determined based upon monthly sampling over a one-year period (May 2000 - April 2001). Tourist activity was higher during autumn and winter, with visits by 'panga' boats being the most numerous. A total of 112 disturbances were recorded, the majority of which being non-anthropogenic causes.  A quarter of disturbances were triggered by human activity within 20m of the rookery and with harassment reaction (animals going into the water) in 32% of the anthropogenic disturbances. Principal component analysis (PCA) described the conditions under which disturbance was generated (74% of the variation explained). Using three factors (47% of the total variation) the major contributing variables were month, tidal level, relative humidity, Beaufort number, total number of boats and number of powerboats and sailboats. In Los Islotes, the perturbation occurs mostly in autumn and winter coinciding with the highest frequency of tourism, large number of adult and subadult males and unfavorable environmental conditions for haul-out, such as high tide level and strong winds. The lowest number of disturbances occurred in summer, during the breeding season of the sea lion. Most of these, however, were caused by human activity.",S.,F.,Martínez-Díaz,,," ",,,D.,,Aurioles-Gamboa,,," ",,,V.,,Labrada-Martagón,,,vlabradam@ipn.mx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

231,"The origin of ambergris","Early and modern theories of the origin of ambergris are described. Ambergris occurs in both male and female sperm whales, and also in the pygmy sperm whale. It occurs in about one in 100 sperm whales. The largest find weighed 455kg and sold for £23,000 in 1914. Ambergris occurs in the rectum of the whale but neither causes nor betrays disease. The rectum is not damaged by squid beaks. Indigestible material, that is, squid beaks and pens and the cuticles of parasitic nematode worms, are regularly vomited by sperm whales and the intestine and rectum can only deal with liquid faeces. When, as sometimes happens, some indigestible material leaks into the intestine and, by at least partly blocking the flow of the faeces, the tangled mass is pushed into the rectum where there is reason to believe that the water absorbing capacity of the rectum is increased (p. 33). In this way the faecal matter is precipitated on the indigestible material to form a smooth concretion and the faeces can pass again. Then more foecal material arrives and the process is repeated. In this way the flow of liquid faeces is maintained, although at the expense of accretionary growth in size of the coprolith which becomes ambergris. Response processes in the whale are constructional. The biochemical processes which transform the coprolith into ambergris are consequential upon its incubation over a long period in the peculiar environment of the rectum teeming with bacteria. Eventually the rectum stretches until it breaks, causing the whale's death and the ambergris is released into the sea.",R.,,Clarke,,,robertclarke007@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

Data were gathered from 1997 to 2004 during research cruises (more than 500 days of sampling effort) aiming to study the biology of humpback whales, and were analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS). Dolphin species were identified on 151 sightings: estuarine dolphin, Sotalia guianensis – 49%; roughtoothed dolphin, Steno bredanensis – 16%; and bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus – 9%. These small cetaceans did not use the area similarly. Distance from coast, distance from nearest river entrance, distance from nearest coral reef, and depth significantly differed among the three species (p < 0.05). Estuarine dolphin distribution was more coastal and concentrated near Caravelas and Doce Rivers. Rough-toothed dolphin distribution was concentrated near the coral reefs in the northern region of the Abrolhos Bank, whereas bottlenose dolphins were widely distributed across the Bank, along various depth ranges. Although the three species coexisted in the northern region of the Abrolhos Bank, our data suggest each showed specific habitat use patterns.",R.,S.,Sousa-Lima,,," ",,,L.,L.,Wedekin,,," ",,,M.,,Rossi-Santos,,,marcos.rossi@baleiajubarte.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
233,"Predation of <i>Otaria flavescens</i> over artisanal fisheries in Uruguay: opportunism or prey selectivity?","Interactions between pinnipeds and fisheries have become an increasingly important topic for fisheries and pinniped management. In particular, the predatory behavior on fisheries is a cause of concern in many places because seals frequently opt to take fish from fishers' gear rather than searching and caching their own food. Sea lion prey selectivity on artisanal fisheries catches was analyzed, with the aim of determining if the predatory behavior was opportunistic or selective. Data were collected through direct observations of sea lion predation onboard during routine fishing trips at four fishing ports on the Uruguayan coast (Buceo, Piriápolis, La Paloma and Cabo Polonio), during two time periods (winter and spring-summer) in 1997/1998. The proportion of the most consumed fish and those most caught by the fishery was analyzed. An odds ratio was calculated as a selection index, using the number of prey items consumed by sea lions, and those caught by the fishery. Two general predatory strategies are apparent, one at the two fishing ports located on La Plata River estuary (Buceo and Piriápolis) and the second at the other two localities on the Atlantic Ocean coast. In the first strategy, the most consumed prey were the same most caught by the fishery (Macrodon ancylodon and Urophycis brasiliensis), suggesting an opportunistic behavior. However, at La Paloma and Cabo Polonio sea lions preyed mostly upon species which were not the main for the fishery (Cynoscion guatucupa in La Paloma, and Mustelus schmitti in Cabo Polonio) and exhibited selections and rejections of other species. Preferences and rejections however, represented small proportions of sea lion consumption and of the fishery catch. Seasonal differences in prey consumption and catches, as well as in selections and rejections were also evident. In some cases prey selections were reversed between both time periods. There was no evidence of an important conflict between sea lions and artisanal fisheries because the most selected species were not the most important for the fishery.",D.,,Szteren,,,dszteren2002@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
234,"Live-captures of common bottlenose dolphins <i>Tursiops truncatus</i> and unassessed bycatch in Cuban waters: evidence of sustainability found wanting","In the period 1986-2004, 238 common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus were exported from Cuba, as shown by UNEP/WCMC data, more than 60% of these to facilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, some 32% to Europe and the rest to Canada and Israel. There is a very significant increase in exported numbers, reaching 28 individuals per annum in 2002. It is unclear how many T. truncatus have been used in domestic dolphinaria. A review of available information did not identify evidence to corroborate hypotheses that: (i) T. truncatus off Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago (where removals occur) does not show population structure; and (ii) virtually no bycatches occur in Cuban waters. Here it is argued that, considering Cuba's fully developed marine fisheries, some level of mortality from bycatch is inevitable. Other potential threats are also identified. Global phylogenetics research of T. truncatus is revealing unexpected and more complex, stock structures, in inshore (coastal) forms within relatively small areas. In Cuba, low mean group sizes (less than 10) suggest that one or more coastal stock(s) are exploited. Sex distribution of measured specimens suggest a significant bias towards extraction of females. It is concluded that sustainability of harvest levels of Cuban T. truncatus cannot be evaluated until abundance estimates become available and population structure is verified by molecular genetic methods. Pérez-Cao (2004) indicated that available density estimates should not be used to determine [safe] catch quotas. The authors strongly recommend that international trade of T. truncatus from Cuba ceases until no-detriment can be authenticated and that more research be developed. Similar arguments may be applicable to other unassessed but exploited populations in the Wider Caribbean.",P.,,Carmo,,," ",,,P.,,Gallego,,," ",,,"G.

236,"What is the colour of the franciscana (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>)? a review and a proposed assessment method","Colouration pattern is suggested as a potentially useful characteristic to identify populations of franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei). Such information is needed for the creation of management and conservation plans for the species. The existence of geographic variation in the colour of the franciscana has been hypothesized; it is suggested that Brazilian and Uruguayan individuals are greyish, while the Argentinean are brownish. We examined individuals from Uruguay using an objective method (Villalobos and Villalobos, 1947) to determine colour patterns. We also reviewed the variation of the colour pattern of the franciscana throughout this species' distribution as noted in the published literature. In the original description of the species in 1844 and in several subsequent papers during the 19th century, the colour pattern of the franciscana was erroneously described (e.g. as black and white). Only since the 20th century have the colouration descriptions approximately matched the actual specimens observed. These descriptions can be typically divided into two basic classes: greyish and ochre/brown. However, within these two general colour groups there is great variation. Several descriptions provided by Brazilian, Uruguayan, and Argentinean authors agree with the above hypothesis. The great variation within the modern descriptions of the franciscana's colour suggests that a variety of factors must be involved; therefore, we conclude that on the basis of the literature alone, it is very difficult to decide whether differences really exist in the franciscana's colour along its distribution. According to Villalobos and Villalobos (1947), the colour pattern of Uruguayan specimens could be interpreted as 'greyish dorsally and yellowish-grey laterally'. Due to some limitations found in this technique, we propose a new method based on the RGB ('red, green, blue') system that may fulfill our expectations for an objective procedure to determine colouration patterns. This standardized method would allow for a reliable comparison of colour patterns among franciscana populations.",R.,,Praderi,,," ",,,M.,,Trimble,,,micatn25@yahoo.com.ar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

244,"Seasonal use of Amazon floodplains by the tucuxi <i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i> (Gervais 1853), in the central Amazon, Brazil","The riverine tucuxi, Sotalia fluviatilis (Gervais, 1853), inhabits an aquatic environment that changes dramatically along the year. The marked annual floods impose a seasonal rhythmicity on the wildlife on these floodplains. The present study provides an insight on tucuxi seasonal use of floodplain, use of area, group size and the occurrence of calves or juveniles within Mamirauá Reserve, Brazilian Amazon. Tucuxis occur year-round in Mamirauá with a mean number of sightings per monthly survey of 3.8. The fluctuating water level in this floodplain influenced tucuxi use of area by allowing or preventing access to water bodies, and influencing its prey movements. The highest encounter rate recorded in the Reserve, for all surveys combined, was 114.3 tucuxis per km (mean = 24.8 per km) with clear tucuxi preference for deep channels with high turbulence and productivity, where prey density is high. Tucuxis were scattered throughout the channels but avoided the lake Mamirauá. Groups of one to 30 tucuxis were recorded, with 91% of groups comprising one to six dolphins (mean = 3.3). Group size showed significant differences among the five systems studied across visual surveys, between years within Mamirauá but not among months. Tucuxi calves or juveniles were recorded year-round.",C.,,Faustino,,,claudia.sea@gmail.com,,,V.,"M.

245,"Ecology of marine tucuxi, <i>Sotalia guianensis</i>, and bottlenose dolphin, <i>Tursiops truncatus</i>, in Baía Norte, Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil","The marine tucuxi (Sotalia guianensis) occurs in coastal waters of western Central and South America sympatric to the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) throughout its range. This paper presents information on ecology based on 228 marine tucuxi and 36 bottlenose dolphin sightings collected during 226 boat-based surveys conducted from 1993 to 2002 in Baía Norte (27°30'S and 48°31'W), Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil. Both species were found year round although seasonal occurrence, sighting indices, sightings per unit of effort as well as group size and composition were strongly different. These features were different for marine tucuxis but similar to bottlenose dolphins when compared to other areas. Marine tucuxis were only found in the western part of the bay while bottlenose dolphins occurred mostly in the eastern section. Distances between species' sightings on the same days averaged 6.9km. Observations were made of both dolphin species feeding on the same fish species, of tucuxis being displaced by bottlenose dolphins and of an adult tucuxi bearing tooth rakes likely to have been caused by bottlenose dolphin attacks. Spatial segregation was not clearly explained by the environmental variables analyzed, suggesting that biological features such as aggression or competition may be influencing tucuxi distribution and social structure in Baía Norte.",P.,"A.

246,"Morphometric relationships of franciscana dolphin, <i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i> (Cetacea), off Rio Grande do Sul coast, southern Brazil","Due to the limited availability of cetaceans, body mass as a measurement of body size is often hard to estimate resulting in reduced sample sizes. Therefore, models for estimating body mass from an analysis of morphometric relationships are useful and practical tools to overcome such difficulties. In the present work, we propose specific models to estimate body mass from morphometric variables of franciscanas inhabiting Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. A total of 226 franciscanas (130 males and 96 non-pregnant females) of all size classes, incidentally caught from 1994 to 2005 off Rio Grande do Sul coast (31°13'S - 33°45'S), were examined. Body mass (BM in kg) was regressed against total length (TL in cm), maximum girth (MG in cm) and a body-volume index: BV(cm3)=TL(cm) x (MG(cm))2. Although linear regressions of body mass on both TL and MG were reliable predictors, a combination of those linear measurements to obtain a body volume index proved to be the best estimator of body mass. Models are the following: BM = 3.68*10-5 BV for males; BM = 3.64*10–5 BV for females and BM = 3.66*10–5 BV for sexes combined. Models presented were valuable methods for indirect body mass estimation for franciscana. Due to the similiarity in the body volume-body mass ratio in males and females, the mixed sexes combined model was deemed most appropriate for estimating body mass. This technique should be of great help in field situations where obtaining body mass is often difficult and sometimes impossible. Developing similar models for franciscanas from the other regions is recommended.",S.,,Botta,,,silvinabotta@furg.br,,,M.,"M.

Prior to 2002, there were very few data on this species in Venezuela and the only reports were based on craneometric studies of stranded animals in the western region. Five new reports on this species have been recorded since in the northeastern zone of the country, based on sightings or assistance of live-stranded animals. Detailed comparisons were made on specimens observed in the field for their corrected identification. These sightings and strandings of F. attenuata are the first reported for the Venezuelan northeast basin, thus increasing the number of reports of pygmy killer whales to seven in the country and extending their known distribution through the southern Caribbean Sea.",L.,A.,Bermudez-Villapol,,,cicvenezuela@yahoo.com,,,A.,J.,Sayegh,,," ",,,M.,A.,Estevez,,," ",,,M.,S.,Rangel,,," ",,,C.,,Rosso,,," ",,,N.,I.,Vera,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

262,"A preliminary overview of skin and skeletal diseases and traumata in small cetaceans from South American waters","We succinctly review and document new cases of diseases of the skin and the skeletal system and external traumata in cetaceans from Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Venezuela. The survey revealed 590 cases diagnosed with a significant pathology, injury or malformation on a total of 7635 specimens of 12 odontocete species examined or observed in 1984-2007. Tattoo skin disease (TSD), lobomycosis-like disease (LLD) and cutaneous diseases of unknown aetiology seem to be emerging in several populations. TSD was confirmed in eight species from the SE Pacific and SW Atlantic. LLD affected only inshore Tursiops truncatus but was found in four tropical countries, namely Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Lobomycosis was confirmed by histology in one male from the Tramandaí estuary, southern Brazil. All LLD-affected specimens were encountered in the vicinity of major ports and cities and a possible association with chemical or organic water pollution is suspected. Whitish velvety cutaneous marks associated with scars occurred in inshore T. truncatus, Sotalia guianensis and Pseudorca crassidens. Large, rounded lesions were seen in a Cephalorhynchus eutropia calf and a C. commersonii. Cutaneous wounds and scars as well as body traumata possibly related to net entanglements and boat collisions were observed in 73 delphinids and Phocoena spinipinnis. Traumatic injuries resulted in the partial or complete amputation and other disfiguring scars of appendages in 17 cases. Fractures of the skull, ribs and vertebrae thought to be caused by fisheries-related interactions or boat collisions were seen in single individuals of Delphinus capensis, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, T. truncatus, S. guianensis and Ziphius cavirostris. Prevalence of osteopathology in small cetaceans from Peru, Brazil and Venezuela ranged widely, from 5.4% to 69.1%. In four species from Peru, lytic cranial lesions were the most frequently observed disease (5.4%-42.9%), followed by hyperostosis and ankylosing spondylitis in offshore (31%, n=42) and inshore (15.4%, n=26) T. truncatus. Fractures and other bone traumata were present in 47.2% of 53 axial skeletons of S. guianensis from the northern Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil) in 1987-1998. A high prevalence (48.4%, n=31) of, apparently congenital, malformations of cervical vertebrae, observed in a 2001-2006 sample, may be explained by a hypothetical genetic bottleneck in this population. Malformations with deficient ossification would clearly increase susceptibility for fractures. This study demonstrates the utility of a continent-wide analysis to discern epizootiological trends more readily than any local study could provide. Secondly, it underscores the need for focussed research on the effects of human activities on the spread of diseases in cetaceans, particularly in near-shore populations that utilize highly degraded coastal habitats.",A.,B.,Fragoso,,," ",,,M.,,Laeta,,," ",,,S.,"M.

263,"Vessel collisions with small cetaceans worldwide and with large whales in the Southern Hemisphere, an initial assessment","Collisions with vessels are a well-documented conservation problem for some populations of large whales (LW) in the Northern Hemisphere. Less attention has been given to incidents in the Southern Hemisphere or to small cetaceans (SC) worldwide, therefore an experimental database was compiled (N=256; 119 LW, 137 SC) to allow a rapid assessment. Confirmed collision records were identified for 25 species (7 LW, 18 SC) and unconfirmed but probable records for 10 other species (2 LW, 8 SC). Among LW, ship-caused mortality and traumatic injuries seem to affect primarily southern right (56 reported cases), humpback (15) and Bryde's whales (13), but also sperm (8), blue (5), sei (4) and fin whales (2) are involved, and probably Antarctic minke and dwarf minke whales. Southern right whale populations off South Africa and off eastern South America (Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina) suffer significant mortality. Incidence and potential population impact vary widely among the 26 small cetacean species for which collision records exist. Vessel strikes in at least two populations each of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Xiamen and Hong Kong/Pearl River, possibly western Taiwan), Irrawaddy dolphin (Mahakam River, Chilika Lagoon, possibly Laos) and finless porpoise (Yangtze River, Hong Kong) may directly compromise long-term survival. Annual vessel-caused mortality (min. 2.9% of population) for Irrawaddy dolphins in the Mahakam River may not be sustainable. The quasi-extinction of the baiji warns for a potential similar fate for the Yangtze River finless porpoise and Ganges river dolphin. Two calves of the endangered Hector's dolphin are known killed by boats. All highly impacted species have a neritic, estuarine or fluviatile habitat, areas where vessel traffic is concentrated. Species that may receive a moderate impact from collisions but which may be sustainable at species level (because many strikes are nonlethal), include common bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, short-finned pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Almost 2% of common bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Guayaquil showed propeller-inflicted injuries and scars. Propeller guards should be made compulsory for all boat-based cetacean tourism, as habituation to boat traffic seems a contributing factor in accidents. Low impact occurs in 15 small cetacean species with only few reported vessel strikes. However, vast underreporting is thought to be the norm and there is a need for a global, standardised database.",Y.,,Wang,,," ",,,A.,,"van Helden",,," ",,,D.,,Sutaria,,," ",,,E.,,Secchi,,," ",,,G.,P.,Sanino,,," ",,,M.,,Iñiguez,,," ",,,J.,,Gedamke,,," ",,,F.,,Félix,,," ",,,A.,N.,Baker,,," ",,,K.,,"Van Waerebeek",,,cepec@skynet.be,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
264,"Ecological aspects of marine tucuxi dolphins (<i>Sotalia guianensis</i>) based on group size and composition in the Cananéia Estuary, southeastern  Brazil","Observations on group size and composition of marine tucuxi dolphins, Sotalia guianensis, found in the Cananéia estuary (25°03'S, 47°55'W), southeastern Brazil, were conducted from May 2000 to July 2003. Correlations among four environmental variables (water temperature, salinity, transparency and depth) and group size were investigated, as well as on the way foraging and feeding behavioral patterns related to group formation in S. guianensis. The  surveyed area comprised approximately 132km and field efforts were conducted in 87 days. A total of 378 groups were recorded. Group size (mean ± SD: 12.4 ± 11.4 individuals) varied from lone individuals, rarely seen, to aggregations of up to 60 individuals. No significant differences were found regarding group size among seasons. Groups with calves (89.7% of all observed groups) were more frequent than groups without calves. Feeding associations with marine birds were common in winter when waters were clearer. A positive correlation was only reported when investigating group size and water depth (Spearman's rank test, r=0.4716, p=0.0000). Marine tucuxis usually form large aggregations (20 to 60 individuals) when engaged in feeding activities in deeper waters. Groups were larger (mean ± SD: 18.3 ±15.0 individuals, n=90) in the main estuary entrance, where water is deeper, and smaller in inland shallower waters (mean ± SD:7.8 ± 6.9 individuals, n=47). Because of these common observed aggregations, this area of the estuary has been used as a dolphin watching site since the late 1990s without specific regulations. Guidelines are urgently needed to conduct dolphin watching tours as calves are seen year-round and uncontrolled tourism may disrupt important social interactions.",S.,,Rosso,,," ",,,M.,"C.

265,"Mass stranding of Baird's beaked whales at San Jose Island, Gulf of California, Mexico","The Baird's or giant beaked whale (Berardius bairdii) is endemic to the North Pacific Ocean. In the eastern North Pacific, seasonal movements are poorly understood. Historic California catches suggest two peaks of abundance, in July and October. Mass strandings of Baird's beaked whales are rare. Prior to this report only two records were known, in the Bay of La Paz, Mexico in 1986 and Sagami Bay, Japan, in 1987; both mass strandings included male and females. Here we report a mass stranding of 10 Baird's beaked whales at San Jose lsland in the Gulf of California on 31 July 2006. The group was composed only by males ranging from 9.97m to 11.05m. The estimated age, based on the dental group layers, ranged from 9 to 42 years. The cause of this stranding is unknown, although with the large number of squid also found dead in the area, it is possible that the whales could have been following the squid, one of their main prey. The mass stranding of 10 mature males reported here supports the idea of a seasonal presence, during summer, of this species in the waters of the southwest Gulf of California. The group composition supports a reproductive strategy where the old males have a major role in the guidance and protection of inexperienced weaned and young males, unlike sperm whale bachelor groups, where all males are typically the same age.",R.,L.,"Brownell, Jr.",,," ",,,W.,,"Del Toro-Orozco",,," ",,,U.,,González-Peral,,," ",,,A.,,"Gómez-Gallardo U.",,," ",,,G.,,Cárdenas-Hinojosa,,," ",,,J.,,"Urbán R.",,,jurban@uabcs.mx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

Sightings during 2004-05 and photographic matches from the early 1990s suggest site fidelity.

268,"Straggler subantarctic fur seal (<i>Arctocephalus tropicalis</i>) on the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil","Eighteen specimens of subantarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus tropicalis) were recorded along the coast of Rio de Janeiro state in the period 1994-2006. Of these, 55.5% (n=10) were males, 11.1% (n=2) were females, and 33.3% (n=6) were of undetermined sex. Most of the records occurred during the austral winter (n=15; 83.3%), with a peak in August, followed by 11.1% and 5.5% during spring and autumn, respectively. There was no record during  summer. All males found and measured were subadults and the two recorded females were one adult and one juvenile. In 2002 six specimens were recorded, accounting for 33.3% of the total records followed by 2000 (n=4; 22.2 %). The records presented here suggest that the population increase in many breeding sites of A. tropicalis could result in new extra limital records. Furthermore, a complex marine current system appears to have an important role on the dispersal of the subantarctic fur seals found along the Atlantic South American coast. In addition, the contact of humans with these pinnipeds could increase the risk of disease transmission.",J.,F.,Moura,,,jailsonfm@gmail.com,,,S.,,Siciliano,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Short Communications",en,"No Decision",Published
269,"Has the manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus</i>) dissapeared from the northern coast of the State of Veracruz, Mexico?","Knowledge about the distribution and abundance of the manatee (Trichechus manatus) along the coast of the Mexican state of Veracruz is scarce. Since few studies have been undertaken in this area, boat-based surveys and interviews with local fishermen were carried out to determine if there are remaining herds of manatees in the vicinity of the coastal towns of Tamiahua, Tuxpan, Tecolutla, and Casitas-Nautla. All of the fishermen interviewed noted that they used to see large herds of manatees in the area. Seventy-four percent (371 fishermen) of the survey respondents had not seen a manatee over the last 10 years, and 26% (131 fishermen) responded that the last time they saw large or small groups of manatees was in 1986 and 1995, respectively. However, since 1996, none of the fishermen had observed any manatees in the area. Similarly, no manatees were observed during the boat-based surveys (effort of approximately 1200km). It is almost certain that anthropogenic influences have altered manatee habitat significantly and thus affected the numbers of animals using the area. Also, fishermen speculated that natural phenomena such as cyclones, flooding, and storms caused manatees to move away from the area. More surveys along the coast of Veracruz are needed to determine if manatees still occur in this Mexican state. Also, it is urgent to implement conservation measures in the northern range of the manatee in Mexico to ensure the survival of this species along its original distribution.",A.,,Serrano,,,arserrano@uv.mx,,,A.,,García-Jiménez,,," ",,,C.,,González-Gándara,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Short Communications",en,"No Decision",Published

272,"Incidental mortality of franciscana dolphin (<i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i>) in Argentina","La Plata River dolphin or franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, is an endemic small cetacean of the Southwest Atlantic coast. It is threatened all along its distribution by a sustained high level of incidental mortality in fisheries. Here we assess levels of franciscana bycatch in Argentine waters between 1997 and 2003. We surveyed 18 localities along the coast of the Buenos Aires Province, between General Lavalle (35°06'S, 57°08'W) and Bahía Blanca (Puerto Rosales-Ingeniero White harbour: 38°47'S, 62°16'W). We recorded data on incidental mortality, fishing gears and fishing effort through 209 personal interviews with fishermen. We estimated annual mortality, fishing effort and catch per unit of effort (CPUE) for each locality and period of time. Mortality was caused by gillnets and trawling gears, purse seine nets and shrimper gears. The total mortality estimated for 1997-2000 was 354 dolphins/year (95% CI = 318-392) and 307 dolphins/year (95% CI = 273-343) for 2002-2003. In the entire survey, CPUE of the northern coast of Buenos Aires Province (Bahía Samborombón and Cabo San Antonio) was significantly higher than CPUE for the southern coast (from Mar del Plata to Bahía Blanca estuary). In addition, CPUE of the northern coast decreased significantly throughout the years. This study suggested that even though the gears or fleet behavior changed locally, Buenos Aires Province evidenced an overall mortality relatively constant during the survey. If we consider a minimum of 400 dolphins killed each year in fishing gear and the estimated population values of 15000 individuals for the Argentine coast; mortality represent more than 2% of the Argentine franciscana population, suggesting that it would be subject to decline. Trends in mortality need to be periodically monitored in this area in order to articulate programs of conservation for the species.",H.,L.,Cappozzo,,,cappozzo@retina.ar,,,M.,F.,Negri,,," ",,,F.,H.,Pérez,,," ",,,D.,,Albareda,,," ",,,F.,,Monzón,,," ",,,J.,F.,Corcuera,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
273,"The ontogeny of shape disparity in three species of Otariids (Pinnipedia: Mammalia)","We compared skull ontogenies in three otariid species to identify evolutionary novelties and to understand their relationships with diversity. The species studied were Arctocephalus australis, Callorhinus ursinus and Otaria byronia. We analyzed evolutionary changes in three parameters of developmental trajectories of skull shape: shape at the outset of ontogeny, allometric pattern, and the amount of change undergone over the course of ontogeny, which depends on its duration (the length of the ontogenetic vector) and on the rate of development. Initial shapes were always very different among the species and the distances between shapes increased with time, independently from size. Furthermore, when the complete samples were considered, all the ontogenetic trajectories were significantly different concerning the directions of the allometric vectors during ontogeny. Ontogenetic trajectories also differed significantly among almost all compared pairs, except for the trajectories of males of A. australis and C. ursinus. However, these differences are expected by chance (considering the range of angles within each sample). A similar pattern was found when the subadults were compared in pairs of species, as well as adult males of A. australis and O. byronia. The correlation found between ontogenies of juveniles was expected by chance, with exception of C. ursinus and O. byronia. The ontogenetic trajectory of C. ursinus, is the shortest and that of O. byronia is the longest, with the latter being near the triple of the former. A. australis has an intermediary length of ontogenetic trajectory. Considering all three species, disparity increased significantly over ontogeny since the disparity of the adults is near double that between juveniles. However, the pattern of disparity did not change considerably during ontogeny. For any ontogenetical stage, O. byronia is the species that most contributed to the disparity of the group, followed by C. ursinus. Finally, ontogenies examined herein are clearly not constrained (almost every developmental parameter of shape that could evolve was observed) and perhaps the differences in patterns have additive effects in the differentiation of the ontogenies.",D.,,Sanfelice,,,daniela.sanfelice@fzb.rs.gov.br,,,T.,"R.

274,"Age estimation in giant otters (<i>Pteronura brasiliensis</i>) (Carnivora: Mustelidae) using growth layer groups in canine teeth","The canines of six giant otters Pteronura brasiliensis (5 males and 1 female) from the zoological collection of the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA) were analyzed for age estimation. Of these, two were from known-age individuals of 2 and 5 years. Ages were read counting the Growth Layer Groups (GLGs) observed in thin sections (30μm) of decalcified teeth. GLGs were present in the dentine but were not conspicuous; age estimates were only reliable when counted in the cementum. Periodicity of GLGs and age estimates were calibrated with the known-age individuals. Results revealed an annual deposition pattern of GLGs in the cementum of giant otter canines, and no apparent differences were found in the GLG patterns observed between males and females, or between captive and free-ranging individuals. The youngest and oldest giant otters analyzed were 2 and 20 years old, respectively. These results suggest that the longevity of captive giant otters is around 20 years. The age determination technique applied here proved to be useful for age estimation in giant otters and can contribute as a powerful tool for future studies on the population dynamics of P. brasiliensis, which is currently classified as endangered.",G.,C.,Oliveira,,," ",,,J.,"F.

275,"Activity budgets and distribution of bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) in the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil","The common bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, is one of the world's best known cetaceans. However, there are few studies on the activity budgets and distribution of this species along the Brazilian coast. This study aimed at describing and quantifying the behavioral activity of T. truncatus in the Patos Lagoon Estuary, Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil (ca. 32°09'S, 52°05'W). The study area was divided into three sub-areas according to the proximity to the estuary mouth. The behavioral data were gathered every 5 minutes following a focal group sampling approach. A total of 34 boat surveys were conducted between December 2001 and January 2003, totaling 66.95h of direct observation and 672 records of behavioral activities. The first 15 minutes of each group encounter were discarded to avoid the influence of the boat approach on dolphin behavior. The most observed behavior was feeding (37.64%), followed by traveling (29.17%), travel-feeding (21.87%), socializing (5.8%), milling (4.33%) and resting (1.19%). There was not a significant difference among the frequencies of commonly observed behaviors: feeding, traveling and travel feeding (p<0.05, t-test for proportions). Dependence between activity and season was detected in subareas I and II (p<0.001; Pearson's &Chi;), as well as an association between activity and sub-areas (p<0.001; Pearson's &Chi;). Regarding group size, 56.41% of the activities recorded were carried out by groups of 1 to 3 dolphins, 31.63% from 4 to 6, 10.25% from 7 to 10, and 1.71% by groups with more than 10 individuals. This study confirmed the importance of the Patos Lagoon Estuary as an area for bottlenose dolphins to conduct their daytime activities, in particular feeding.",P.,H.,Mattos,,,biofurg@yahoo.com.br,,,L.,,"Dalla Rosa",,," ",,,P.,F.,Fruet,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
276,"Prey occurrence in the stomach contents of four small cetacean species in Peru","The diets of long-beaked common dolphins Delphinus capensis (n=117), dusky dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus (n=72), Burmeister's porpoises Phocoena spinipinnis (n=69) and offshore common bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus (n=22) were determined based on the analysis of the stomach contents collected from animals landed in ports along the Peruvian central coast and from Marcona, in southern Peru, during 1987-1993. The number of prey ingested was obtained by counting the number of fish otoliths and cephalopod mandibles (beaks). Only fish could be identified to species level. Long-beaked common dolphins fed mainly on Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens (70.0% by number), Panama lightfish Vincigerria lucetia (7.8%) and slimtail lanternfish Lampanyctus parvicauda (6.7%). Dusky dolphins consumed mainly anchovies (49.7%, 16.8%), slimtail lanternfish (23.6%, 0.1%), Inca scad Trachurus murphyi (17.1%, 0%) and mote sculpin Normanichthys crockeri (0%, 76.0%) off the central Peruvian coast and Marcona, respectively. In the same areas, Burmeister's porpoises fed mainly on anchovy (88.9%, 77.6%), silverside Odontesthes regia (6.5%, 0%), mote sculpin (0%, 8.1%) and South Pacific hake Merluccius gayi (0.6%, 7.9%). Offshore common bottlenose dolphins consumed mainly slimtail lanternfish (39.2%), barracuda Sphyraena sp. (13.5%) and Peruvian pilchard Sardinops sagax (13.3%). The diversity indices of the diet and temporal shifts in the main prey suggest an opportunistic feeding strategy for the four cetacean species studied, which take advantage of the locally most available epipelagic and mesopelagic schooling fish. Cluster analysis shows high similarity in their diets, with these four marine top predators being able to optimally exploit the high productivity of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem.",I.,,García-Godos,,,ag_godos@yahoo.com,,,K.,,"Van Waerebeek",,," ",,,J.,C.,Reyes,,," ",,,J.,,Alfaro-Shigueto,,," ",,,M.,,Arias-Schreiber,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

283,"By-catch of franciscana <i>Pontoporia blainvillei</i> in Uruguayan artisanal gillnet fisheries: an evaluation after a twelve-year gap in data collection","The franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei) is the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Its incidental capture in the Uruguayan fisheries of the Atlantic oceanic coast (AOC) has been recorded since 1940 and was systematically studied from 1974 to 1994, providing the most recent by-catch per unit of effort estimate (BPUE) for the AOC region (0.0064 franciscanas per 1000m net per fishing set). The lack of new by-catch data during the past 12 years has led to a data gap in by-catch estimates for the species in Uruguay. The current study was developed in two separate stages, a first stage (July 2004 - December 2005) designed to identify fisheries that interact with franciscana, and a second stage (2006), designed to determine new BPUE and franciscana mortality estimates for the selected fisheries. During the first stage, 13 artisanal fisheries of the Uruguayan coast were visited monthly, while in the second stage five fisheries (including the Rio de la Plata estuary and the AOC) were selected for monitoring. During 2006, 26 fishermen recorded all the information related to each fishing event, allowing the estimation of fishing effort calculated in linear units multiplied by hour (FEL). We also estimated a fishing set (FES) based by-catch rate which allowed the comparison with previously reported results. For 2006, the BPUEL (based on FEL) was estimated at 0.0020 franciscanas per 1000m net per hour and the BPUES at 0.0286 franciscanas per 1000m net per fishing set. The BPUEL was extrapolated to the surveyed fishing fleets during 2006, resulting in a mortality estimate of 289 (95% CI: 266-350) franciscanas. Based on the fishing dynamics reported herein, we consider the BPUEL the most accurate estimate of by-catch for the Uruguayan coast. This research updates the values of BPUE in the AOC after a 12-year information gap and includes the first by-catch evaluation in the Uruguayan estuarine coast. We highly recommend an abundance estimation of the species to complement the information reported herein in order to know the current status of franciscana dolphin population in Uruguay.",V.,,Franco-Trecu,,,franciscana@fcien.edu.uy,,,P.,,Costa,,," ",,,C.,,Abud,,," ",,,C.,,Dimitriadis,,," ",,,P.,,Laporta,,," ",,,C.,,Passadore,,," ",,,M.,,Szephegyi,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
284,"The odontocete community and its environment in the southwestern Gulf of California","Community structure is a function of the number of species, their relative abundance and the characteristics of the dominant, common and rare species that are part of it. It also can be described by changes in its physical and biological environment. The aim of the present work is to describe the odontocete community, its temporal changes and the relationship with environmental variability and food availability in the southwestern Gulf of California (GC). Information was obtained from 21 sampling trips from September 2003 to March 2006 between La Paz Bay and Loreto, with a sampling effort of 8769.1km. We recorded the presence, location and other biological parameters of odontocete sightings. Data on environmental variability was obtained from satellite images of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration, and food availability from published reports. A total of 30201 odontocete cetaceans were recorded from 353 sightings, belonging to 10 different species. We observed a temporal lag between the peaks in productivity and an increased presence of odontocete species. The community structure showed a seasonal change in the abundance of the dominant (Tursiops truncatus and Delphinus sp.) and common species (Globicephala macrorhynchus and Kogia sp.), as well as by the absence or presence of scarce (Physeter macrocephalus and Orcinus orca) and rare species (Pseudorca crassidens and Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). This seasonal community change is in agreement with the known seasonal movements of its main prey inside the GC, which, in turn, is related to seasonal environmental variation. We observed that the community structure was dominated by fish-eating species during the temperate season and responded to the increased presence and aggregation of sardines (Sardinops sagax caerulea) in the southern GC, whereas the warm season was dominated by squid-eating species and related to the increased presence and aggregation of the jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) in the GC's west coast.",C.,J.,Salvadeo,,,chsalvadeo@yahoo.com.mx,,,A.,,"Gómez-Gallardo U.",,," ",,,D.,,Lluch-Belda,,," ",,,J.,,"Urbán R.",,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
285,"Winter distribution and group composition of humpback whales (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) off northern Peru","From late July to the end of September 2009, the temporal and spatial distribution and group composition of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) were studied in order to provide new information about the species in northern Peru, the southern limit of the breeding area for the Southeast Pacific population. Daily surveys were made from a whale-watching boat from Los Organos (04°10'38.78""S, 81°8'04.40""W) and covering an area of approximately 74km2. Data about geographic position and group composition are presented. A total of 43 trips yielded a total of 124 sightings. Whales were observed throughout the study period with a peak in abundance in late August. Humpbacks were distributed mainly in shallow waters between 20 and 50m depth. Pairs and trios were the most common group type, whereas adults and mother/calf pairs were the principal sex/age classes. Our data confirms breeding and nursing activities in the southern limit of the wintering area for the Southeast Pacific stock. Frequent use of the shallow waters of the northern Peruvian coast by fishing operations may cause negative impacts on this sensitive phase in the humpback's life cycle. Thus, strengthening the current protection measures is encouraged.",A.,S.,Pacheco,,,babuchapv@yahoo.com,,,S.,,Silva,,," ",,,B.,,Alcorta,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
286,"Diet of the manatees (<i>Trichechus manatus manatus</i>) in Chetumal Bay, Mexico","Manatees, as well as other sirenians, are aquatic, opportunistic herbivores. Knowledge of their diet is important to determine habitat requirements. This is the first study of manatee diet in México. Our main objective was to identify the plant species eaten by manatees in Chetumal Bay, and to establish if diet composition varied by climatic season, sex or age class. We compared plant epidermal fragments found in feces with histological descriptions and permanent collections of suspected plants and algae. Thirty-six fecal samples and nine tract digestive content samples (mouth, stomach, and cecum) were examined. We found eight distinct plant items, including seagrasses, freshwater grasses, algae and vascular plants. Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum were found in 41 samples (92%), and Ruppia sp. was present in 57.8%. Another common item was red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), found in 66.7% of samples. Additionally, we report Chara sp. and Najas sp. as part of the West Indian manatee's diet outside of Florida. A multivariate analysis based on a presence/absence triangular matrix and a similarity analysis were used to test differences among samples. Season, sex or age class did not influence diet composition. All species identified are present in Chetumal Bay, suggesting that manatees do not move long distances at sea in search of food. We postulate that consumption of red mangrove by Chetumal Bay manatees may occur as compensation for the scarcity of submersed aquatic plants, which has not been reported for other habitats for this species.",D.,N.,Castelblanco-Martínez,,," ",,,B.,,Morales-Vela,,,bmorales@ecosur.mx,,,H.,A.,Hernández-Arana,,," ",,,J.,,Padilla-Saldivar,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published

No pathological manifestations were observed associated with the presence of the parasites in the present study. The prevalence observed in the State of Ceará and the lack of reports of this parasite species in other states of northeastern Brazil may suggest the existence of an isolated population, a higher occurrence of the intermediate host, or differences in the feeding habits of the manatees.",V.,L.,Carvalho,,,vitorluz@yahoo.com.br,,,A.,"C.

302,"ASSESSING BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES OF COMMON BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (Tursiops truncatus) TO BIOPSY SAMPLING IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL.","Cetacean biopsy sampling is a widely used technique with undisputable scientific value. Although generally considered unharmful and with no long-lasting effects, this intrusive technique may inflict some cost to the individuals involved. Therefore, the potential impacts of biopsying should ideally be assessed as part of the sampling protocol, in particular regarding small cetacean populations. We evaluate the sampling efficiency and the behavioral responses to biopsy sampling of a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) inhabiting the Patos Lagoon estuary, in southern Brazil. Darts were fired using a 68Kg crossbow. Twenty-nine shots hit the dolphins, resulting in an 86.2% success rate of skin and blubber sampling from hits. The amount of skin collected ranged between 0.061g and 0.76g (mean= 0.15; sd= 0.065) and provided enough material to amplify mtDNA control region and Microssatelite loci. Bottlenose dolphins reacted to 93.1% of hits and 73.3% of misses, but no significant difference was detected (x2= 3.79; p= 0.0516, df=1). Reactions to biopsy attempts were generally low-level and of short duration, and no strong reactions were observed. Dolphins reacted more intensively to hits than misses (x2 = 6.42, p<0.05, df=2). Group size and pre-biopsy behavioral state were not a determinant factor affecting the reactions though socializing dolphins and lonely individuals seemed to react more intensively. Our results suggest that biopsy sampling of free-ranging bottlenose dolphins in the Patos Lagoon estuary using crossbow-fired darts does not cause medium or long-term effects on dolphin behavior.",Pedro,Friedrich,Fruet,BR,,pfruet@yahoo.com.br,,"Museu Oceanográfico ""Prof. Eliézer de C.

308,"THE BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN (Tursiops truncatus MONTAGU, 1821) AND ITS INTERACTION WITH ARTISAN FISHERS IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL","The Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus Montagu, 1861) and its interaction with artisan fishers in Southern Brazil – strives to identify the interaction that exists between the dolphin (T. truncatus) and the artisan fishermen of Rio Grande do Sul, in the south of Brazil (~30°S, 32°S), resulting from traditional knowledge. In November and December 2009 44 interviews were carried out with fishermen who worked in the Imbé/Tramandaí region (N=22) and in the southern part of the Lagoa dos Patos in Rio Grande (N=22). These accounts maintained that T. truncatus are recognized according to the location they are seen in, coloration, and body size. Those interviewed described this fishery interaction as both positive—as when dolphin corralled schools of fish and correctly showed fishermen their locations—as well as negative—as when they stole fish from nets, indicated the wrong positions of schools to fishermen, and became entangled in cast nets. The accidental capture of dolphin in fishing nets was described by fishermen from both regions, but was not recognized by them as a negative aspect of the interaction for the dolphin. According to their perceptions, the negative impact resulting from interaction with artisan fishing was not significant in this region of Southern Brazil.",Camilah,,Zappes,BR,,camilah_az@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued

311,"Mark-recapture vs. line-transect abundance assessment of a costal dolphin population: a case study of Tursiops truncatus from Laguna, southern Brazil","Cetacean populations in coastal habitats are increasingly threatened by multiple anthropogenic impacts. Monitoring these populations is critical for meeting conservation goals and robust estimates of abundance are required to detect significant trends. We conducted a pilot study to test the effectiveness of two commonly used abundance estimation methods, mark-recapture and line-transect, in assessing the abundance of bottlenose dolphins in Laguna, southern Brazil. We compared both techniques in terms of cost, time and effectiveness for detecting trends for a five-year monitoring program using power-analysis models. The mark-recapture models, analyzed with the program MARK, resulted in an abundance of 50 individuals (CI: 40-62) with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.11. The line-transect models, using the program DISTANCE, estimated an abundance of 61 individuals (CI: 39-95), with a CV of 0.22. Comparing both approaches, mark-recapture was 1.30 times more expensive than line-transect for a single season effort, but was also 2 times more effective in terms of precision. Because of this, for mark-recapture the probability of detecting a declining trend of 5% during a five-year period was 2.36 times higher. The final cost for detecting a trend is 1.37 times higher for the line-transect method, which also require seven years more of effort. These results highlight the importance of method choice and show the need for developing pilot studies in planning future efforts. Considering the small population size estimated herein, the sensitivity of both approaches for detecting trends is not sufficient because the original population would be markedly reduced by the time a declining trend was detected. Thus, a precautionary approach is still imperative, even when robust estimates are obtained.",Fábio,G.,Daura-Jorge,,,daurajorge@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued

316,"POPULATION SIZE AND RESIDENCE PATTERNS OF COMMON BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (Tursiops truncatus) IN THE TRAMANDAÍ ESTUARY, SOUTHERN BRAZIL","The occurrence of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Tramandaí estuary, southern Brazil, is described base on a photo-identification study conducted between January 2009 and February 2010. A total of 128 surveys days were conducted with an average observation effort of 2.6h per day (SD=0.6). Approximately 2,050 photographs were taken from a shore land location in the mouth of the estuary. A total of nine dolphins were identified, including three calves. The dolphins were observed during all seasons, with a greater frequency during fall (79.3% of the days) and winter (60.7% of the days). The summer presented the lowest occurrence (2.4% of the days) of the dolphins. During the entire period of the study, the maximum number of individuals sighted in a same day in the estuary ranged from one to seven (average = 2.8 dolphins; SD = 1.35; n = 51). Most of the time the dolphins were seen alone or in small groups, such as mother and calf pairs or trios. The association levels of individuals were relatively weak (< 0.39). The residence pattern, based on the re-sighting frequency, ranged from 0.02 to 0.26. However, most of the animals (66.7%) showed a high degree of residency (>0.15) along the year and could be classified as residents. A multi-year fidelity pattern was also detected by the re-sighting of four dolphins for over 18 years. The present data, in conjunction with the available information, confirmed the uniqueness of this bottlenose dolphin population and highlighted the need for conservation measures to guarantee its long-term survivorship.",Amanda,,"Di Giacomo",BR,,amandagiacomo@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued

318,"REPORTS OF STRANDINGS AND SIGHTINGS OF Tursiops truncatus IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL","This study revises and updates information on Tursiops truncatus strandings and sightings in Northeastern Brazil. A total of 71 strandings were recorded from 1992 to 2010, and 51 sightings were recorded from 1988 to 2010 along the state of Ceará to Bahia, including Fernando de Noronha and São Pedro and São Paulo archipelagos, Rocas Atoll and Abrolhos Bank. More strandings were recorded in the states of Pernambuco, Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte.  The number of reports was higher during summer, but no statistically significant difference was found as compared to that in other seasons. The majority of the stranded animals were adults (47.9%). Calves were not recorded. Total body length ranged from 138 to 321cm:  138 to 310 cm for males; and 168 to 288 cm for females. Average adult body length   was 280cm (SD=0.21). In events where sex was determined (n=29), a highly statistically significant difference   was found   between the number of males (n=21) and females (n=8). A total of 6 animals (8.5%) showed evidence of fishery interactions such as net marks or removal of   meat, blubber and eyes. Twenty two sightings were recorded in the northeastern region, mostly in islands and Rocas Atoll. This finding shows that T. truncatus is an oceanic species in the region.

319,"Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus, Montagu 1821) in central-north coast of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil: stranding pattern and insights of feeding habits","The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the best known cetacean in the world. However, few studies about ecology, biology and threats have been conducted in Brazilian coast. The aim of the present work is to analyze the strandings pattern and stomach contents of T. truncatus in the central-north coast of the Rio de Janeiro state. Thirty seven stranding events were recorded through a regular beach survey and also through the access to previous studies. The strandings were distributed throughout the study area, but there was a trend of occurrences in the extreme south and north regions. Seven specimens showed evidence of accidental mortality in fishing nets. There were no statistic differences (X2; p>0.05) in the four seasons of the year. In addition, there were significant differences in the number of strandings by sex (X2; p<0.05). Most bottlenose dolphins stranded were classified as adults (> 230 cm of body length) (X2; p>0.05). The body length varied from 160 to 335 cm. Four prey species were found in the stomach contents from the three specimens of T. truncatus analyzed. The most representative prey species was the cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus). The present study showed that bottlenose dolphin is a common species along the Rio de Janeiro state where it feeds principally on coastal fishes. Future studies need to be realized to improve the knowledge of this poorly known cetacean in Brazil.",Jailson,,Moura,BR,,jailsonfm@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued
320,"Effective population size of an offshore resident population of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, from the Archipelago of São Pedro and São Paulo, Brazil","The Archipelago of São Pedro and São Paulo (ASPSP) (00º56’N; 29º22’W) lies c.1,010 km northeast of the coast of Rio Grande do Norte, in the Brazilian waters. Recently, through the photo-identification and the group size analysis, around 20-30 individuals of bottlenose dolphins,  Tursiops truncatus from ASPSP were recognized as a resident and genetically isolated population. For evolutionary matters, the effective population size (Ne), not the census number (Nc), is a prime concern as well the sex ratio. Furthermore, the estimate of Ne reflects the number of individuals responsible for the maintenance of the genetic diversity of the species or population as well its evolutionary potential. Since the purpose is the conservation of species as dynamic entities capable of evolving to cope with environmental change, it is important that the species evolutionary potential must be retained in order to respond to the current and unpredictable climate change scenario. In this sense, we present here the first Ne and also sex ratio estimates for the bottlenose dolphin population from ASPSP. Sex was molecularly identified for 19 biopsies collected from bottlenose dolphins from ASPSP between January and February 2005. The Ne was estimated by the direct counting of the reproductive adults sexed by DNA. The resulting Ne was 12 specimens and the sex ratio was 1.11 males to 1 female, however, it was not statistically different from the expected ratio of 1:1 (c2 test, a=0.05; df=1). We believe that the estimated Ne for the ASPSP population is a critical value, because it is significantly lower than the mean minimum viable population (MVP) for vertebrates (around 5,000 breeding age adults). In this sense this small Ne is reason of great concern for this population and should be taken into account in future management plans to ensure the conservation and protection of the species at ASPSP.",Larissa,,Oliveira,BR,,larissaro@unisinos.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued
321,"The bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus (Montagu, 1821) from Brazilian Northern coast","Tursiops truncatus is a relatively large dolphin, reaching 4,0 meters length, the body’s color may vary in gray tons, with pinkish belly.

In Southwestern Atlantic this species ranges from Amapá coast (northern Brazil) until Argentina, in Chubut province. Despite of  large dispersion along South America, this dolphin counts with scarce records in Brazil’s north coast.

325,"Diurnal and seasonal activity budget of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in Bahía San Antonio, Patagonia, Argentina","The diurnal and seasonal activity budget of bottlenose dolphins was assessed in Bahía San Antonio, Patagonia, Argentina, through systematic boat-based surveys carried out between August 2008 and December 2010. Total field effort of 462.3h resulted in 80.7h of behavioural observation of 107 dolphin groups. Results indicated that dolphins spent most of their time resting, feeding and travelling in the study area, with a marked diurnal pattern. It could be seen how dolphins rested mostly during the early morning, and increased feeding and social activities in the afternoon, a diurnal trend that remained consistent over the different seasons. The proportion of time dolphins spent in the different behaviours did vary over the seasons. Socializing and surface feeding increased during winter and spring, whereas during summer, dolphins seemed to spend up to half their time in a diving behaviour, presumably associated with a tail out/peduncle-dive foraging strategy. Most dolphin groups encountered were disperse, regardless their behaviour. Overall, median group size was 4, varying significantly over the seasons and with behaviour. Dolphin groups engaged in surface feeding and socializing were significantly larger than those engaged in any other behaviour. Further, dolphin groups were significantly larger in winter and spring than during summer and autumn. These data suggest more prey availability during winter and spring with dolphins feeding mostly on shoaling fish species, and a notable decrease in prey availability during summer when more benthic species are being targeted. The increase in social behaviour during winter and spring, might further suggest a general breeding pattern during these seasons.",Els,,Vermeulen,BE,,elsvermeulen5@gmail.com,,,Alejandro,,Cammareri,AR,,ale@marybio.org,,,Ludo,,Holsbeek,,,lholsbeek@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"Revisions Required",Queued

331,"Natural history of dolphins of the genus <i>Sotalia</i>","General biology, including food habits, reproduction, age and health of the dolphins of the genus Sotalia, are reviewed according to current scientific knowledge. At least 25 teleost fish families, 5 cephalopod families and 1 crustacean family are included in the diet of the Guiana dolphin (S. guianensis), while up to 13 fish families were identified in the stomachs of the tucuxi (S. fluviatilis). Among the fish consumed by Sotalia spp., the schooling fish are the most common ones and both dolphin species use similar foraging strategies. However, due to the completely different ecosystems used by them, prey species consumed by these dolphins are also different. The maximum age of incidentally caught Guiana dolphin was 30yr and the maximum age estimated in the tucuxi was 43yr. The maximum total body length and weight reached by S. guianensis was 222cm and 121kg, respectively, and for S. fluviatilis 152cm and 53kg, respectively. Sexual maturity in the Guiana dolphin was estimated to occur at 170-180 cm in males, and 160-169 cm in females, while onset maturity in the tucuxi occurs at around 140cm in males and 132-137 cm in females. Ovulation apparently occurs only in the left ovary of the tucuxi, while both ovaries of the Guiana dolphins are functional. The proportion of testes mass in relation to total body mass in adult males can reach up to 5% in the tucuxi, and 3.3% in the Guiana dolphin, suggesting a promiscuous mating system with sperm competition in both species. Although seasonal birth peaks can occur in Guiana dolphins, they seem to reproduce throughout the year. However, the tucuxi presents defined birth seasonality, with most females giving birth during the low-water season in the Amazon. We suggest maintaining S. fluviatilis in the ‘Data Deficient’ category of the IUCN Red Data Book. Nevertheless, due to the recent recognition of S. guianensis as a species, its conservation status has not been assessed yet. This species, however, deserves special attention as it is strongly subjected to anthropogenic pressures throughout its distribution.",F.,"C.

332,"Mitochondrial DNA diversity, differentiation and phylogeography of the South American riverine and coastal dolphins <i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i> and <i>Sotalia guianensis</i>.","Here we consider the phylogeography and population structure of the South American coastal and riverine dolphins, Sotalia guianensis and Sotalia fluviatilis, based on samples (n = 76) collected across more than 9000km of the species distribution. Phylogenetic reconstruction of 31 distinct haplotypes based on a combined analysis of two mitochondrial gene fragments (1052bp) revealed clear genetic differences between riverine and coastal individuals consistent with species-level ranking. Within the coastal species, a spatial analysis of molecular variance of the control region sequences showed significant regional population differentiation (FST = 0.4; FST = 0.6; P<0.001). The highest mitochondrial diversity among costal population units was found along the Caribbean Coast of Colombia and Venezuela. The genetic distinctiveness of the Maracaibo Lake (Venezuela) population has conservation implications regarding the threats faced by the animals in this region, including oil exploitation. Brazilian populations of Sotalia showed the lowest mitochondrial diversity and differentiation among the coastal species warranting further investigation. The Amazonian populations showed the highest mitochondrial diversity overall, suggesting a surprisingly large effective population size (Nef) and relatively high female gene flow throughout the sampled regions of the main river and its tributaries. From our results, at least two different conservation strategies need to be developed for each of the proposed sister-species. For the coastal groups, characterized by restricted gene flow and very localized populations along the Caribbean and Atlantic Coast of South America, it is advisable to work at a local level in order to improve the fishing practices and prevent frequent dolphin entanglement in nets. For the Amazonian groups, priority must be given to maintain the connectivity detected between regions. Obstacles to connectivity, including hydroelectric and dam construction, as well as excessive boat traffic, could affect the future of these populations.",S.,,Caballero,,,sj.caballero26@uniandes.edu.co,,,F.,,Trujillo,,," ",,,J.,A.,Vianna,,," ",,,H.,,Barrios-Garrido,,," ",,,M.,G.,Montiel,,," ",,,S,,Beltrán-Pedreros,,," ",,,M.,,Marmontel,,," ",,,M.,"C.

333,"Initial description of Major Histocompatibility Complex variation at two Class II loci (DQA-DQB) in <i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i> and <i>Sotalia guianensis</i>","Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a key role in the initiation of immune response in jawed vertebrates. Variation at MHC loci can be used as an indicator of the genetic ‘health’ of natural populations and offer insight into potential susceptibility to epizootics. Here we present the first characterization of the sequence variation at two MHC class II loci (DQA and DQB) in the neotropical coastal (Sotalia guianensis) and riverine (Sotalia fluviatilis) dolphins, using cloning and direct sequencing of amplified genomic DNA. Four DQA and four DQB alleles were identified in 33 and 32 Sotalia samples, respectively, and high nucleotide diversity among these alleles was detected, similar to the findings described for other cetacean species. Positive selection was evidenced by an excess of dn/ds at the Peptide-Binding-Region of the DQB of Sotalia. The presence of common alleles at both loci in S. fluviatilis and S. guianensis are consistent with trans-species mode of evolution in the MHC. In contrast to observed low levels of mtDNA diversity at the population level, there was an apparent lack of reduction of DQA and DQB allelic variation in the Brazilian Coast population unit. This suggests either present or past balancing selection acting to maintain MHC variation in this population unit.",S.,,Caballero,,,sj.caballero26@uniandes.edu.co,,,D.,,Heimeier,,," ",,,F.,,Trujillo,,," ",,,J.,A.,Vianna,,," ",,,H.,,Barrios-Garrido,,," ",,,M.,G.,Montiel,,," ",,,S.,,Beltrán-Pedreros,,," ",,,M.,,Marmontel,,," ",,,M.,"C.

Strandings of Guiana dolphins were recorded systematically and opportunistically in the coast of Ceará (~02-04°S), northeastern Brazil, from 1992 to 2005. A total of 160 single events were documented. The number of records was higher in Fortaleza Metropolitan Region than in other three surveyed areas, probably due to a more intensive survey effort. More strandings were recorded during austral winter and spring. The majority of stranded animals were adults (48.8%). Calves were not commonly recovered and no seasonality in the strandings of calves was observed. Overall body length ranged from 95 to 208cm for females and from 85 to 210cm for males. A total of 49 animals (30.6%) showed evidence of fishery interactions such as net marks and cuts. Of these, we confirmed through fisherman information the incidental catch of 13 dolphins by driftnet (n = 8), surface gillnet (n = 3) and beach seine (n = 2). Twenty three percent of all stranded animals showed evidences of other human interactions, like meat or fins removed, eyes removed and rostrum extracted. According to the results, Guiana dolphin strandings occurred year-round in all zones along the coast of Ceará. The incidental bycatch in fishing nets may have a negative impact on the dolphin population. The study reveals that a long-term systematic monitoring of artisanal fishing communities is necessary to evaluate the extent of the impact on the species.",A.,"C.

335,"Ecology and conservation status of tucuxi (<i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i>) in the Pacaya-Samiria Reserve, Peru","The distribution, relative abundance, group size, reproductive seasonality, and conservation status of tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) were investigated in Peru’s Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve from 1996 to 2000. Data collection consisted of boat-based surveys of dolphins and habitat, necropsies, photo-identification of individual dolphins, and interviews with local people. Mean encounter rates were between 0.01-0.80 tucuxi/km in rivers, and 0.05-2.17 tucuxi/km2 in lakes, and were within the ranges reported for riverine tucuxi throughout their distribution. Encounter rates were highest in confluences, intermediate in lakes, and lowest in rivers. Encounter rates increased with river width. Most tucuxis were seen within 100m from shore in large rivers, and large groups were associated with confluence areas and mid-channel islands. Within lakes, tucuxis were associated with areas of deeper water. Tucuxis were not found in waters <3m depth in rivers, or <1.8m depth in lakes. Seasonal differences in encounter rates did not exist in lakes and rivers. In confluences tucuxis occurred in highest densities during low water, and lowest densities during high water. Diurnal patterns of occurrence were not observed. Tucuxis were seen most often as singles or pairs, although groups as large as 13 were observed. Significant seasonal differences in group size were not detected. Neonate tucuxi were observed in all seasons, with a slight peak in encounter rates during high water. Abundance estimates were affected by survey methods, and strengths and weaknesses of various methods are discussed. Photo-identification rates were low, and this method did not yield information about tucuxi site fidelity, movement patterns, social structure, or population size. Local people in the Reserve did not seem to have the same myths and general apprehension about tucuxis as for the other sympatric dolphin, Inia. There was no evidence that tucuxi were poisoned by fishermen, unlike Inia. Potential threats to tucuxi in this region were entanglement in fishing gear, mercury in migratory fish from gold mining elsewhere, oil spills, ship strikes, and disturbance from boats. Only one dead tucuxi was encountered, and had been entangled in a turtle net. Tucuxi teeth were found for sale in local markets.",T.,L.,McGuire,,,tmcguire@lgl.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
336,"Habitat use of the Guiana dolphin, <i>Sotalia guianensis</i> (Cetacea, Delphinidae), in the Caravelas River Estuary, eastern Brazil","Habitat use patterns of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) were assessed in the Caravelas River Estuary, eastern Brazilian coast (17°54’S, 39°21’W). During 191 surveys (2002-2004), 187 groups were sighted. The Arcview 3.1 software was used to create a GIS environment that included the distribution of dolphin sightings, a 5x5km quadrats grid, and the bathymetry of the study area. Each quadrat was characterized according to environmental variables such as depth, contour index, distance from sand banks and distance from the coastline. The Caravelas River mouth was found as the core area of the dolphins. Guiana dolphins did not use the several classes of environmental variables homogeneously, occurring more frequently in shallow waters, closer to sand banks and closer to the coastline. Also more dolphins occurred in areas with flatter bottoms and in waters with salinity ranging from 35 to 38ppm, despite dolphins being sighted in waters 14km inside the river. Dolphins used a wide range of habitat types but the Caravelas River mouth seems to propitiate the most adequate conditions for foraging strategies or concentration of prey.",M.,R.,Rossi-Santos,,,m.rossisantos@yahoo.com.br,,,L.,L.,Wedekin,,," ",,,E.,"L.

337,"Residence patterns of the Guiana dolphin <i>Sotalia guianensis</i> in Babitonga bay, south coast of Brazil","Photo-identification and video-identification techniques were applied to study the residence of Sotalia guianensis in the Babitonga Bay, north coast of Santa Catarina State. From November 2000 to February 2003 a photo-identification effort was conducted trough 21 months, with additional video-identification conducted from August 2003 to August 2004, totalling 34 months of identification effort. Fifty-one different animals were identified with residence rates varying from 2.9% (n = 1 sighting) to 67.6% (n = 23 sightings). During the four years it was found that more than 30% (n = 16) of identified individuals were observed during three years, and 25% (n = 13) only were seen within one year. Considering previous studies, the longest period of residence reached eight years for one individual. Due to the high rates of resightings observed for most of the animals and the small percentage of animals only seen once, it is clear that S. guianensis is resident year-round in the studied area.",F.,"A.

338,"Occurrence of chlorinated pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Guiana dolphins (<i>Sotalia guianensis</i>) from Ubatuba and Baixada Santista, São Paulo, Brazil","Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in the blubber of six Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from the coast of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. PCBs were at the highest levels on a lipid-weight basis (25.87 to 66.03μg g-1), followed by DDTs (16.91 to 55.91μg g-1), mirex (0.24 to 1.87μg g-1), chlordanes (0.11 to 0.49μg g-1), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (0.07 to 0.17μg g-1), heptachlor epoxide (0.05 to 0.16μg g-1) and hexachlorociclohexane (HCHs) (0.03 to 0.21μg g-1). The presence of PCBs in Guiana dolphins suggests input from the Cubatão industrial complex – the largest in Brazil. The mean p,p’-DDE/3DDT ratio was approximately 0.8 and is indicative of previous DDT application in the study area. The occurrence of HCB and HCHs can be attributed to industrial effluents and dumping on the borders of the Santos-São Vicente estuarine complex.",M.,B.,Alonso,,,alonso.mb@gmail.com,,,J.,,Marigo,,," ",,,C.,P.,Bertozzi,,," ",,,M.,"C.

339,"Sounds produced by the tucuxi (<i>Sotalia fluviatilis</i>) from the Napo and Aguarico rivers of Ecuador","The acoustic structure and repertoire of the tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) remain poorly studied. This lack of information limits our understanding of how acoustic signals evolved and the factors that promote variation across and within populations. Using a broadband recording system, we recorded 30 whistles from tucuxis in the Napo and Aguarico Rivers, Ecuador. Our results show that Ecuadorian tucuxis emit a variety of sounds including whistles, echolocation clicks, and pulse sounds. Whistles structure varied with respect to other populations described in previous studies, providing preliminary evidence of geographic variation. In addition, this study provides evidence of high order harmonics in whistles (up to 80kHz) highlighting the importance of broadband recording systems.",L.,J.,May-Collado,,,lmaycollado@gmail.com,,,D.,,Wartzok,,," ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Published
340,"Morphology of the Guiana dolphin (<i>Sotalia guianensis</i>) off southeastern Brazil: growth and geographic variation","The objective of this study was to analyze the morphology of Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) to evaluate the existence of geographical variation along southeastern Brazil. Body length and 39 cranial variables were measured of specimens stranded or accidentally captured to consider ontogenetic and geographic variations. The areas studied were Espírito Santo (ES; 18°30’S-20°40’S), northern Rio de Janeiro (NRJ; 21°35’S-22°25’S), southern Rio de Janeiro (SRJ; 23°00’S-23°07’S) and São Paulo (SP; 23°30’S-25°30’S). Body length at age zero predicted by a non-linear Gompertz model for the Guiana dolphin was 148.3cm for area ES, 108.97cm for area NRJ, 98.4cm for area SRJ and 90.9cm for area SP. Asymptotic values were reached at about six years of age for total body length and cranial variations. These results indicate that Guiana dolphins reach adult size and sexual maturity simultaneously at six to seven years of age, when specimens cease to grow. The growth pattern for body and skull size indicated that there is variation between geographic areas. Guiana dolphins found in São Paulo are smaller than those analyzed in northern Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo, which implies a different growth rate. A canonical discriminant analysis of the cranial metric characters indicated significant differences between the four geographic areas. Differences between areas NRJ, SRJ and SP were responsible for 54% (axis 1) and 34% (axis 2) of the variation, respectively. The third axis depicted a difference between the area ES and the others. A partial overlap between geographic areas was observed in the projection of the species on the canonical axes, suggesting parapatry. Geographic variation recorded in this study is likely to be related to environmental adaptations. One of the areas that could play a role in the distribution of Guiana dolphin in the surveyed area is the central coast of Rio de Janeiro, which is characterized by the absence of river discharges, a narrowing of the continental shelf and upwelling influence that might be limiting the species occurrence in this area.",R.,"M.

341,"Cervical ribs and cleft arches in Brazilian <i>Sotalia guianensis</i>: contribution to comparative studies of skeletal morphology in northern and southeastern specimens","The Guiana dolphin, Sotalia guianensis (Van Bénéden, 1864), is a delphinid species found along the Brazilian coast. Morphological and genetic data point to the existence of different biological populations of the species within this portion of the range. The present paper compares the frequencies of developmental anomalies in two skeletal collections from geographically distant areas. The vertebral column of 43 specimens from Marajó Bay, located on the Pará State coast, and 20 specimens from the central-north coast of the Rio de Janeiro State were analyzed. The only anomalies found were cervical ribs and cleft neural arches, both located on the seventh cervical (C7) vertebra. Cervical ribs were found in 12% of the Pará specimens and in 45% of the Rio de Janeiro specimens; according to the Fisher’s Exact Test the difference was significant at a confidence level of α = 0.01, thus confirming that the series belong to different populations. The frequencies of cervical ribs observed in the present study were also compared to the frequencies of the same anomaly found in S. guianensis from the Ceará and Santa Catarina states, Brazil, and in tucuxi (S. fluviatilis) from the Brazilian Amazon. Although the results can be partially explained by demographic and evolutionary models for Sotalia, they may be affected by differences in the composition of the collections and in diagnostic methods/criteria used by different authors. Regarding the presence of cervical ribs, Amazon tucuxi were significantly different from the Rio de Janeiro and Pará series, as well as other marine series, as previously stated in the literature. The difference in the frequency of cleft neural arches in specimens from Rio de Janeiro and Pará was also significant, but no comparison could be conducted with other series due to lack of published material. A metric technique to discriminate transverse processes with and without fused cervical ribs is proposed as a methodological contribution for diagnosing the described anomaly.",M.,,Laeta,,,mairalaeta@gmail.com,,,S.,"M.

349,"INSIGHTS ON RESIDENCY AND SKIN DISORDERS ON BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) OFF BAIA NORTE, SANTA CATARINA STATE, SOUTHERN BRAZIL","A preliminary evaluation of the occurrence and description of epidermal disease as well as of the residency in common bottlenose dolphins off Baía Norte, southern Brazil is presented. Thirty-nine individuals were photo-identified from 67 groups (n = 251 individuals, based on direct counts) photographed on 47 days in which bottlenose dolphins were encountered during 1994-2005. Identified dolphins were resighted on up to seven different days over as many as six different years and up to 11 years timespan. Of the identified dolphins, 12.8% (n=5) had epidermal disorders. All of these were large individuals, presumed to be adults. These disorders ranged from small de-pigmented areas to white or cream-clored star-like patches to extensive multi-colored botches, wrinkles, lumps, abcesses and skin eruptions. One animal showed intense evolution of skin disorders over 20 months, while another individual developed disorders during the study period. Some of the lesions observed in bottlenose dolphins off Baía Norte could possibly be mycotic such as Lobo’s disease or be otherwise infectious, leading also to potential inter-specific contagious to the sympatric Guiana dolphis and franciscanas. The residency pattern of bottlenose dolphins in Baía Norte is similar to other coastal populations of the species. Although the occurrence of skin disorders may be low compared to other populations, this needs further investigation.",Paulo,A.C.,Flores,BR,,paulo.flores@icmbio.gov.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Notes,en,"No Decision",Queued
350,"Growth of the skull of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, in the Southwestern Atlantic","Skulls of fifty-three specimens of the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, found stranded along the coasts of southern Brazil, Uruguay and northern Argentina (27o35’S 48o34’W - 36o49’S 55o19’W) were analyzed for 60 measurements to compare the growth rate of the different functional apparatuses. Age was estimated by counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) in the dentine of decalcified, stained longitudinal-sections of teeth. Growth was represented by von Bertalanffy’s equation. Cranial maturity starts at age 2 and stabilizes at age 5, among the different measurements. Comparing the apparatuses as a single unit, the Braincase is the most precocious apparatus, while the Feeding is the latest. The Hearing, Vision and Breathing apparatuses have similar patterns of development. An analysis of variance revealed significant differences between the apparatuses ages of maturity, but not in the von Bertalanffy’s growth equation parameters.",André,Silva,Barreto,BR,,abarreto@univali.br,http://www.univali.br/cttmar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued

353,"Occurrence of Pinnipeds in Santa Catarina between 2000 and 2010","  Presently in the Brazilian coast, there are records of four species of otariids and of three phocids: Otaria flavescens (Shaw, 1800), Arctocephalus australis (Zimmerman, 1783), Arctocephalus tropicalis (Gray, 1872), Arctocephalus gazella (Peters, 1875), Mirounga leonina (Linnaeus, 1758), Lobodon carcinophagus (Hombron & Jacquinot, 1842) and Hidrurga leptonyx (Blainville, 1820). In Santa Catarina between the years of 2000 and 2010 there were records for all of them except for the last two. The species with higher occurrence were A. australis, with most records being of juveniles in the southern portion of the state. Records of A. tropicalis were from juveniles and adults, both in the northern portion of the state. Otaria flavescens was recorded regularly, mainly in the south of the state. There were only two records for M. leonina and one for A. gazella during the time for this study. The occurrence of pinnipeds in the state was observed mainly in winter and spring. In some cases human activities were possibly associated with the animal’s death, as well as with live animals that had to be relocated after stranding of populated areas. In these last cases, the management of the animal was necessary since the animal could be injured by the presence of curious bystanders and domestic animals.",Amanda,de,Oliveira,BR,,amandadeoliveira_green@hotmail.com,,,André,Silva,Barreto,,,abarreto@univali.br,,,Cristiane,"Kiyomi Miyaji",Kolesnikovas,,,criskolesnikovas@gmail.com,,,Patrícia,Pereira,Serafini,,,patricia.serafini@icmbio.gov.br,,,Luciana,"Magnabosco de Paula",Moreira,,,luciana.moreira@icmbio.gov.br,,,Monica,,Pontalti,,,institutobaleiafranca@gmail.com,,,Paulo,César,Simões-Lopes,,,lamaqsl@ccb.ufsc.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued
354,"FIRST ABUNDANCE ESTIMATION OF COMMON BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN (TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS) (CETACEA, DELPHINIDAE) OFF URUGUAYAN ATLANTIC COAST","The common bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus is the most frequently observed small cetacean in the Uruguayan coast. Historically, its distribution was wider, including the estuary of the Río de la Plata, but currently its occurrence seems to be restricted mainly to the Uruguayan Atlantic coast (Rocha Department). Conflicting interests and tradeoff between conservation and development are being generated in Uruguay, which on the one hand promotes the establishment of protected areas, responsible tourism and sustainable fisheries, and on the other facilitates foreing investment to exploit natural resources and development of mega-infrastructure in coastal zone. In this work we provide the first abundance estimate of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Uruguayan Atlantic coast, which can be used as baseline information for monitoring trends and guiding conservation. Data of photo-identified animals with long-lasting natural marks were applied to mark-recapture models for closed populations. The estimated total population size for the year 2008 (combining marked and unmarked dolphins) was 54 individuals (CI 95%= 50-58) and 64 individuals (CI 95%=53-77) for Chapman’s and Mth models, respectively. Although abundance are in the range of values obtained for other coastal bottlenose dolphin populations in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, as well as, other regions of the world, it is lower than the values reported for population inhabiting open habitats. This small population is probably vulnerable to non-natural removals, environmental and demography stochasticity. Therefore, precautionary actions are recommended given the planned development for this coastal region.",Paula,,Laporta,UY,,paula.laporta@gmail.com,,,Pedro,,Fruet,BR,,pfruet@yahoo.com.br,,,Eduardo,,Secchi,,,edu.secchi@furg.br,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Articles,en,"No Decision",Queued
